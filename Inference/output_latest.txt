User > My pachysandra got volutella. I cut everything to 3 inches and removed all debris. I also sprayed with copper fungicide. Many plants are now recovering, but there are still stems that are brown and brittle. However, pulling one out, the root is yellow and moist. Regarding volutella and pachysandra roots, before I replant, do I need to remove the brown remaining stems?

Title: Volutella Blight of Pachysandra
leaf spots on pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra collapse of pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra blighted leaf on pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra leaf spot beginning on pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra leaf blight, volutella pachysandrae, on japanese pachysandra can be very detrimental to the plant. two other leaf spots, phyllosticta and gloeosporium, cause leaf spots on foliage but are not as destructive as volutella. ground covers, such as pachysandra, are sometimes used where grass or other plants will not grow due to low light. consequently, the environmental stress factors, including prolonged leaf wetness or dry soils, can favor certain infectious diseases in the sites. symptoms and diagnosis volutella blight begins as small, brown to tan spots on the leaves that enlarge to form blotches. these blotches can then spread and coalesce to form a blight where young growing tissue, especially leaves and twigs, are killed. concentric line patterns form within the brown spots as leaves yellow and fall. infected stems become brown to black in color and die. circular, spreading areas on diseased plants will be noticeable in the planting. the disease will be especially severe when plants are crowded and wet conditions prevail. many spore masses cause the spread of the disease, which is especially rapid among plants that have been weakened by the attack of scale insects or by winter injury. the sexual stage of this fungus is pseudonectria pachysandricola. under moist conditions, salmon - to pink - colored masses of fungal spores form on the surface of dead stems in spring. initial infections may lead to large patches of plants killed. integrated pest management strategies 1. maintain plant vigor. purchase healthy plants and maintain this condition by watering during drought. water early in the day so that drying occurs before evening. avoid splashing of water. fertilize as needed or as indicated by soil testing. 2. select planting area carefully. plants should be planted in a well - draining soil. if the site is persistently wet, amend the soil or raise the bed before planting. 3. removal. lift out and destroy severely diseased plants. bury or remove from the site. do not place in the compost pile. 4. use fungicides. it is difficult to thoroughly apply fungicides unless using a forceful sprayer. fungicides can be applied beginning in spring and at 7 to 14 day intervals through early summer. once temperatures rise above 90of, discontinue application. pesticides registered for use include chlorothalonil, copper, mancozeb, and thiophanate methyl. 5. mulch. mulch with leaf mold in the spring to cover up fallen debris containing inoculum. 6. thinning. thin plants in fall, during dry weather, to remove dense growth. 7. pests. scale is a harmful pest on pachysandra and may make it more susceptible to disease. the female insects are dark brown and shaped like oyster shells. the males are smaller and narrower, pure white, and are very prominent on the leaves and stems. heavy infestations of scale can be brought under control by applying summer oil spray before the new growth starts in spring. follow this with several applications of a scale insecticide like malathion or sevin at 2 - week intervals or several applications of a scale insecticide or summer oil every 10 days to 2 weeks starting in mid - may. strategies 2, 3, 5, and 6 are strictly organic approaches. using an appropriate organic fertilizer would be a viable organic approach to strategy 1. of the fungicides listed in strategy 4, consult the organic materials review institute ( omri™ ) for appropriate organic copper products. pesticide disclaimer : always follow the product's label and ensure the product is effective against volutella. not following the pesticide label before usage is a violation of federal law.

User: Is this a female Osoberry flower? I planted an Osoberry (Indian plum) in the garden, and I assumed it would be male and I'd need to find a female (to produce fruit), but as the buds are just starting to flower, the info I find online compared to mine make me think I might have lucked out and have a female plant?!

Title: Why Are My Wax Begonia Leaves Curling? – Cafe Planta

wax begonias are delightful additions to any plant collection, with their glossy leaves and vibrant flowers. however, if you've noticed those charming leaves starting to curl, you might be scratching your head in confusion. don't worry, you're not alone! leaf curling can be a common issue, and there are several reasons why it might be happening to your wax begonia. in this article, we'll look at the possible causes of leaf curling in wax begonias and offer practical solutions to help you get your plant back to its flourishing best. from environmental factors to pesky pests, we'll explore each aspect with the goal of making sure your plant regains its healthy, beautiful appearance. let's get started! understanding leaf curling in wax begonias first, let's take a moment to understand what leaf curling really is. leaf curling appears as twisted or folded leaves, and it's often a sign that something's not quite right with your plant. it could be a subtle plea for help, signaling that it needs a change in its environment or care routine. leaf curling can result from a variety of issues, including environmental stress, pests, diseases, nutritional deficiencies, or improper watering practices. recognizing the specific cause can be a little tricky, but once you pinpoint it, you're well on your way to helping your wax begonia thrive once more. interestingly enough, leaf curling isn't unique to wax begonias. many plants exhibit similar symptoms when something's off. so, if you have other plants, the knowledge you gain here might come in handy for them, too! environmental factors : light and temperature wax begonias, like many houseplants, have specific preferences when it comes to their environment. light and temperature play crucial roles in their overall health, and any imbalance can lead to issues like leaf curling. light : wax begonias thrive in bright, indirect light. too much direct sunlight can cause the leaves to curl and even scorch, while too little light can lead to a lack of growth and vitality. if your plant is sitting in a spot with intense afternoon sun, consider moving it to a location where it can enjoy bright but filtered light. a sheer curtain or a few feet away from a south-facing window might do the trick. temperature : these plants prefer a warm environment and can suffer if temperatures drop too low. aim to keep your wax begonia in a place where the temperature stays between 60 - 75°f ( 15 - 24°c ). avoid placing your plant near drafty windows or doors, especially during colder months, as sudden temperature changes can stress the plant and cause the leaves to curl. keeping an eye on these environmental factors and making small adjustments can often make a significant difference in your plant's health. watering practices : finding the right balance watering is both an art and a science when it comes to houseplants. for wax begonias, improper watering is a common culprit behind leaf curling. but don't worry, getting it right is simpler than you might think. overwatering : one of the most frequent mistakes is overwatering, which can lead to root rot — a condition where the roots sit in waterlogged soil and begin to decay. this can cause the leaves to curl as the plant struggles to uptake nutrients and water. to avoid this, make sure your wax begonia is in a pot with drainage holes, and allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again. underwatering : on the flip side, underwatering can also cause leaves to curl as the plant becomes dehydrated. signs of underwatering include dry, crispy leaves in addition to curling. if you suspect underwatering, give your plant a good soak and adjust your watering schedule to prevent future issues. one tip is to pay attention to the weight of the pot. a light pot might mean the soil is dry, whereas a heavy pot could indicate it's too wet. this simple method can help you find the right balance for your wax begonia. pests : unwanted visitors sometimes, the cause of leaf curling in wax begonias is not environmental at all but due to tiny, unwelcome guests. pests like aphids, spider mites, and thrips can be responsible for causing stress to your plant, resulting in curled leaves. aphids : these small, sap-sucking insects can cluster on the undersides of leaves, causing them to curl and distort. you might notice a sticky residue on the plant, known as honeydew, which aphids secrete. spider mites : these tiny creatures are hard to spot but leave behind telltale signs like webbing and speckled leaves. they thrive in dry conditions, so increasing humidity around your plant can help deter them. thrips : these pests are slender and often found inside the curled leaves. they feed on plant tissue, leading to discoloration and curling. to manage pests, you can gently wash your plant with a mild soap and water solution or use neem oil as a natural insecticide. regularly inspecting your plant and keeping it clean can prevent pest infestations before they start. diseases : fungal and bacterial issues diseases can also be a factor in leaf curling. fungal and bacterial infections can cause significant stress to your wax begonia, and addressing them promptly is essential for your plant's recovery. powdery mildew : this fungal disease appears as a white, powdery coating on the leaves. it often thrives in humid conditions and can cause the leaves to curl and become distorted. to treat it, increase air circulation around your plant and consider using a fungicide if necessary. bacterial leaf spot : this disease manifests as dark, water-soaked spots on the leaves, leading to curling and wilting. it's important to remove affected leaves and avoid overhead watering to prevent the spread of bacteria. keeping your plant in a well-ventilated area and avoiding excessive moisture on the leaves can help prevent these diseases. if you notice any signs of infection, take action quickly to avoid further damage. nutritional deficiencies : feeding your plant right just like us, plants need a balanced diet to thrive. nutritional deficiencies can lead to a variety of problems, including leaf curling in wax begonias. nitrogen deficiency : a lack of nitrogen can cause older leaves to turn yellow and curl. providing a balanced fertilizer during the growing season can help address this issue. potassium deficiency : this can result in leaf edge curling and browning. a fertilizer with a higher potassium content can remedy the deficiency. wax begonias generally benefit from a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer applied every 4-6 weeks during the growing season. be sure not to over-fertilize, as this can lead to salt build-up in the soil, which can also stress your plant. repotting and soil issues sometimes, leaf curling can be related to issues with the soil or the pot itself. ensuring your wax begonia has the right environment to grow is crucial for its health. soil quality : wax begonias prefer well-draining soil. if the soil retains too much moisture, it can lead to root problems and leaf curling. consider using a potting mix designed for houseplants, which typically contains a blend of peat, perlite, and vermiculite to ensure good drainage. pot size : over time, your begonia may outgrow its pot, leading to root-bound conditions. when this happens, the roots don't have enough space to spread out, which can stress the plant and cause leaf curling. repotting your plant into a slightly larger pot every couple of years can help. when repotting, gently loosen the roots and remove any dead or rotting sections. this will give your wax begonia a fresh start and encourage healthy growth. stress from transplanting or environmental changes wax begonias can be sensitive to changes in their environment. if you've recently moved or transplanted your plant, it might be experiencing stress, leading to leaf curling. transplant shock : after repotting, it's common for plants to go through a period of adjustment. this shock can cause leaves to curl temporarily as the plant acclimates to its new surroundings. environmental changes : moving your plant to a different location with different light or temperature conditions can also result in stress. gradually acclimating your plant to a new environment can help minimize the impact. give your wax begonia some time to adjust, and continue providing consistent care. it should bounce back once it's settled into its new home. humidity levels : keeping the air moist humidity is an often-overlooked factor in plant care, yet it's crucial for wax begonias. these plants hail from tropical regions and appreciate a bit of moisture in the air. low humidity : in dry environments, especially during winter when indoor heating is on, the lack of humidity can cause leaves to curl. to raise humidity levels, consider misting your plant regularly, placing a humidifier nearby, or setting your plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water. high humidity : on the flip side, excessive humidity can encourage diseases like powdery mildew. ensuring good air circulation and keeping the leaves dry can help prevent these issues. monitoring the humidity levels in your home and making adjustments as needed can create a more comfortable environment for your wax begonia. leaf curling in wax begonias can stem from a variety of causes, ranging from environmental factors to pests and diseases. by understanding these potential issues and making thoughtful adjustments, you can help your plant regain its vitality and beauty. remember, a little attention to detail goes a long way in keeping your wax begonia happy and healthy. at cafe planta, we're passionate about helping you care for your plants. our shop offers a wide range of houseplants, care accessories, and even plant-themed apparel. if you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to email us or send a dm on instagram. we're here to support you on your

User > I'm trying to eradicate old orange daylilies from a very large hillside, about 200 x 18 ft, where I want to remove the patches of daylilies that have spread over many years. I aim to transform this area into a haven for native plants, many of which naturally thrive there already. I have replaced some daylilies with more natives. I've used Round Up twice last year and once early this spring but wish to avoid it now due to the native plants. I hope to eliminate these daylilies by the end of the summer to seed the area or plant more small plants in the fall. Though the photos aren't the best, you might notice how sickly these plants look. Mainly, I'm considering cutting off the remaining green/yellow leaves to expedite their demise. What do you think? I continue to dig them out gradually, as other methods like smothering aren't feasible here. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated!

Title: Leaf-Eating Caterpillars: Eastern Tent Caterpillar, Spongy Moth, Fall Webworm | Riverbend Landscapes & Tree Service
##y antennae. the tent caterpillar larvae grow to 2 ” long or more. they ’ re dark with yellow tufts and a white stripe running down their back. female moths lay eggs in shiny, dark - brown masses that encircle small branches, where they overwinter. in spring, the eggs hatch and the caterpillar larvae begin defoliating leaves on the host tree. after a month or so, the larvae mature and crawl down to the ground to find a sheltered place to make their white cocoons. the pupae develop in a matter of weeks and emerge as adult moths to mate and lay eggs for the following year ’ s generation. eastern tent caterpillar the best way to reduce next year ’ s population is to remove and destroy egg masses in fall and winter. the pests also have several natural predators, including many bird species, which eat the caterpillar larvae during daylight hours. if those measures aren ’ t enough, you can spray caterpillar larvae with pesticides. this should be done as early in spring as possible when the larvae are small. it may be difficult to spray effectively when little foliage has emerged, but direct spraying will kill the larvae. as with fall webworm, spraying the webs will not reach the larvae sheltering inside. apply residual, foliar insecticide sprays to leaves and twigs during the day when caterpillars are out eating leaves and reapply it regularly. if you ’ re spraying fruit trees, only use insecticides designed for fruiting trees. do not burn webs! fire and flames can seriously damage your trees. the spongy moth ( lymantria dispar dispar ) is a major pest of hardwood trees in northern virginia, as larvae rapidly defoliate trees. the caterpillars are an inch or more in length, black or brown, with spots along their backs and tufts of bristle - like hairs. female moths have white wings with black markings, and are flightless. male moths have darker, brownish wings with black markings, feather - like antennae, and can fly. spongy moth egg masses are tan, and covered with wing scales from the adult female moth. the masses hold hundreds of eggs, and can be found on outdoor surfaces of all kinds. moving items that hold spongy moth eggs is one way the insect is spread, so inspecting all items is vital to prevent the insect ’ s spread. adult moths in emerge in early summer, after pupating. the adult moths mate in summer, and female moths lay eggs that will overwinter, hatching the following spring. spongy moth larvae ( caterpillars ) hatch in spring, and voraciously defoliate trees as they go through their larval stages. while annual populations of spongy moth fluctuate, severe or repeated defoliation of garden and forest trees can kill large numbers of trees. its preferred species is oak ( quercus ), but spongy moth caterpillars feed on hundreds of tree species, including : - boxelder ( acer negundo ) - american mountain ash ( sorbus ) - lombardy poplar ( populus ) - sweetgum ( liquidambar ) spongy moth quarantine in virginia loudon and fairfax counties have been under spongy moth quarantine for some time, as have all but a few virginia counties. for details, see the virginia spongy moth quarantine map published by the state ’ s department of agriculture. in addition to vehicles, household items, and machinery left outside, firewood is one of the most common ways that insect eggs and larvae are spread. to prevent the spread of destructive insects to forests and wildlands, virginia state parks forbid campers and visitors from bringing firewood into the parks. information about firewood quarantines is here. controlling spongy moth controlling spongy moth is difficult, but homeowners can take the following steps : - scrape off egg masses from surfaces and submerge in soapy water for a few days to kill the eggs. - spray egg masses with a horticultural oil spray designed for spongy moths. - wrap tree trunks with sticky bands to catch larvae as they crawl down tree trunks. for homeowners, virginia tech ’ s agricultural extension website has information about spongy moth management here. the most effective control of spongy moth larvae in forests is entomophaga maimaiga, a fungus that kills spongy moth larvae. wet spring weather encourages the growth of the fungus, which controls larvae by overwhelming it with fungal spores. when the larvae die, the spores are released and are carried on the wind to other larvae. this fungus, which overwinters in soil, targets only spongy moth larvae. give us a call at 703 -

SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE DEVELOPMENT:

Leaf and stem blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in the

Northeast. It is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandrae. Patches of

wilting and dying plants often indicate the presence of Volutella blight in a

bed of pachysandra. Both leaves and stems are attacked by this fungus. Leaves

develop irregular tan to brown blotches, often with concentric lighter and

darker zones with dark-brown margins. These blotches gradually increase in size

until the entire leaf turns brown or black and dies.

Stem cankers often develop and cause whole plants to die back. These appear as a

browning of the stem at the terminal, midstem, or at ground level. Cankers first

appear greenish-brown and water-soaked, but eventually turn brown or black and

shrivel. As these cankers girdle the stem, they cause the whole plant to wither

and die. During wet, humid weather in late spring and summer, affected plant

parts can be covered with reddish-orange, cushion-like fruiting structures of

the fungus. Spread of the disease within the planting is by means of these

fungal spores. Plants often die in patches and the disease commonly produces

circular patterns in the bed. Volutella blight is more severe in plantings

weakened by winter injury, insect infestation, recent transplanting or shearing, 

drought, and exposure to full sun.

Control can be accomplished by following a multifaceted approach that

includes sanitary, cultural, and chemical controls. All plant debris and

severely disease plants should be removed and destroyed. The planting should be

thinned periodically to prevent dense growth and increase light and air

circulation. Among the fungicides registered for use are thiophanate methyl and chlorothalonil. Plants should be sprayed when new growth starts in

the spring and repeated according to label directions to protect newly emerging

tissues. Additional applications may be necessary during wet weather. The

pesticide label will contain information on dosage rates and safety precautions. 

Since Volutella blight is associated with plant stress, attempts should be made

to control insect infestations and to maintain good growth and vigor by watering

during periods of drought and fertilizing in the spring. Since water favors

disease development, watering is best done early in the day so that drying

occurs. Thick, heavy mulches should be avoided since they hold moisture. It is

also important to remove any leaf or plant debris from the bed before growth

resumes in early spring.

Volutella blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in Connecticut and the Northeast. This disease is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandrae. Symptoms can vary from irregular, tan to brown blotches with concentric-ring patterns on the leaves to stem cankers that result in extensive wilting and death of large patches of plants within a planting bed. In addition to descriptions of these symptoms, this fact sheet includes a discussion on strategies to minimize the impact of this common disease.

Title: Volutella Blight – Wisconsin Horticulture

what is volutella blight? volutella blight is a common and potentially lethal disease of japanese pachysandra ( pachysandra terminalis ), an evergreen, semi - woody groundcover that is grown in shade gardens throughout hardiness zones 4 and 5 in wisconsin. volutella blight can severely limit the aesthetic appeal of pachysandra wherever it is grown. what does volutella blight look like? volutella blight begins as discrete, water - soaked areas ( lesions ) on pachysandra leaves and stems that eventually turn black / brown and become necrotic ( i. e., die ). lesions can be circular, oval or irregular in shape, and may have darker margins. distinct concentric rings also may be visible in the lesions. lesions on a single leaf can merge and cause the collapse of the entire leaf, while stem lesions can lead to the collapse of an entire pachysandra plant. when severe, volutella blight can kill large patches of a pachysandra planting. where does volutella blight come from? volutella blight is caused by the fungus volutella pachysandricola which survives in infected plants, as well as on and in pachysandra plant debris. during wet weather, this fungus produces masses of light - orange to pink fungal spores and hyphae ( i. e., fungal threads ) that may be visible to the naked eye. how do i save a plant with volutella blight? remove diseased leaves, as well as any leaf debris, and prune back or dig up plants with stem infections. dispose of this material by burning ( where allowed by local ordinance ), burying or hot composting it. be sure to prune only when plants are dry to minimize the spread of the causal fungus. be sure to clean your pruning tools between cuts by treating them for at least 30 seconds in a 10 % bleach solution or ( preferably due its less corrosive properties ) 70 % alcohol ( e. g., rubbing alcohol, certain spray disinfectants ). if you use bleach, be sure to thoroughly rinse and oil tools after you are done pruning to prevent rusting. when disease is severe, follow leaf and plant removal by treating remaining plants with one or more applications of a broad - spectrum fungicide ( e. g., one containing chlorothalonil ). select a product that is labeled for use on pachysandra, and follow all label instructions to ensure that you apply the product in the safest and most effective way possible. how do i avoid problems with volutella blight in the future? v. pachysandricola is a somewhat opportunistic pathogen, most often causing problems on pachysandra that is weakened or under stress. therefore, reduce any stresses where possible. reduce stress due to overexposure to sun by always planting pachysandra in a shady area. do not overcrowd new plantings, and thin existing beds to not only reduce stress from competition but also to promote good air flow and rapid drying of plants. dry plants are less likely to become infected than plants that stay wet for extended periods. to prevent water stress during the summer and reduce winter injury over the winter, established pachysandra should receive approximately one inch of water per week during the growing season up until the point where there is snowfall or the ground freezes. newly planted pachysandra should receive approximately two inches of water per week. if there is insufficient rain, water plants using a soaker or drip hose. minimize salt usage on sidewalks or driveways near pachysandra beds to limit salt injury that can predispose plants to infection. control insect pests and avoid over - pruning of pachysandra to limit wounds that might serve as entry points for v. pachysandricola. for more information on volutella blight : contact the university of wisconsin plant disease diagnostics clinic ( pddc ) at ( 608 ) 262 - 2863 or pddc @ wisc. edu.

leaves. if you ’ re growing your begonias outdoors and you notice curling leaves, look at other nearby plants of different species. do they have curled leaves, too? or perhaps their foliage is wilting and yellowing? if so, it ’ s highly probable that they ’ ve suffered herbicide injury. even if you didn ’ t apply herbicides in your own garden, it ’ s possible that some wafted over from a neighbor or maybe your local government applied herbicides to public areas nearby. or perhaps you recently treated your lawn? you might wonder if what you are seeing is a result of a pest or disease issue. typically, specific pests or diseases stick to plants in the same genus or family. powdery mildew in legumes, for example, is caused by microsphaera diffusa while in begonias it ’ s caused by oidium begoniae. but if totally unrelated species are symptomatic, the cause is usually something else like a watering issue or herbicide damage. so, if your begonias and nearby hostas are both showing symptoms of leaf curl, it ’ s probably not a pest or disease issue since the plants are from different genera. if you suspect herbicides are the problem, there ’ s not much to do except find where they came from and stop it from happening again. 3. mealybugs or scale sapsuckers like mealybugs and scale cause stress to the begonia, and this stress can result in curling leaves. both scale and mealybugs are fairly easy to identify once you know what to look for. both are oval and flat, and either brown, tan, black, or white with a waxy coating. they like to hang out on the stems and at the leaf joints, so look closely in those areas. these pests don ’ t move much, and they tend to cluster together, so people sometimes mistake them for symptoms of a disease. but try scraping them off and squishing them – if they come off easily or they can be smashed, they are bugs, not symptoms of a disease. i know, gross. if scale or mealybugs are the cause of the leaf curl, you can simply scrape them off the plant using a butter knife or dab them with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. broad, tropical, or begonia mites ( polyphagotarsonemus latus ) are an invisible monster. they ’ re about 0. 02 millimeters in length, so you won ’ t be able to see them with the naked eye. these pests thrive in the same conditions as begonias, namely warm and humid. you ’ ll find them all over in greenhouses and tropical areas and they feed on many warm - weather species. when the mites feed on the plant, they cause the terminal leaves to curl and roll. they can also cause deformed buds and stunted growth. you can get out a magnifying glass and examine the begonias closely to try and see the mites. they like to hide in areas that are shaded and hidden. if you see them or even suspect an infestation, treat the plant with insecticidal soap. spray once a week with the soap on a day when there is no rain expected if your plants are outside. insecticidal soap is handy to have around since it tackles many insect problems"

User > Mango Tree Leaves? In August my mango started dropping leaves, starting with the oldest. The leaves looked healthy, but the last few I took pictures of had brown edges down the sides. I have tried spraying with several different fungicides and it's still happening! All that's left now is the new growth from the tree being topped in October. I would so appreciate any help you could give me!

Trillium ovatum, commonly known as the Pacific Trillium, Western Wake-robin, Western White Trillium, or Western Trillium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae. It is the most widespread and abundant Trillium in Western North America. Its type specimen was gathered by Meriwether Lewis during the return trip of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1806. The most widespread of the Western North American Trilliums, Trillium ovatum varies greatly within its range. Despite this, t. ovatum closely resembles the Eastern t. grandiflorum. Apart from geographic location, the two species are not easily distinguished. Trillium ovatum is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of underground rhizomes. At maturity, each plant has one or two flowering scapes, each 20 to 50 cm (8 to 19.5 in) in length. The specific epithet ovatum means "egg-shaped", which refers to the petals, not the leaves. The latter are generally ovate-rhombic, 7 to 12 cm (3 to 5 in) long by 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) wide. The flower sits on a pedicel 2 to 6 cm (1 to 2.5 in) in length. The sepals are 15 to 50 mm (0.59 to 1.97 in) long and 6 to 20 mm (0.24 to 0.79 in) wide, while the petals are 15 to 70 mm (0.59 to 2.76 in) long and 10 to 40 mm (0.39 to 1.57 in) wide. Typically the flower opens white and becomes pink with age, but in the Smith River Canyon area of Northern California and Southern Oregon, the petals become almost barn-red. Trillium ovatum was first described by the German-American botanist Frederick Traugott Pursh in 1813. The type specimen for this species was gathered by Meriwether Lewis along the Columbia River during the return trip of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1806. As of April 2024, the following varieties are accepted by Plants of the World Online in addition to Trillium ovatum Pursh: Trillium ovatum var. oettingeri (Munz & Thorne) M. Renner Trillium ovatum var. oettingeri was first described as Trillium ovatum subsp. oettingeri by the American botanists Philip Alexander Munz and Robert Folger Thorne in 1973. The subspecific name oettingeri honors Frederick W. Oettinger who collected the type specimen in July 1967. The type is one of about 1,500 specimens collected by Oettinger in the Marble Mountain Wilderness of the Salmon Mountains in Western Siskiyou County, California. Hence Oettinger's Trillium is also known as the Salmon Mountains Wake-robin. Trillium ovatum var. oettingeri itself was treated by Frederick W. Case Jr. in Flora of North America in 2002. Unlike the typical variety ovatum, variety oettingeri has leaves with short petioles and linear flower petals. In 2024, the taxon was recommended at species rank based on morphological data and phylogenetic analysis. Trillium ovatum var. stenosepalum was described by the Canadian-born geneticist Reginald Ruggles Gates in 1917. Its type specimen was collected in Helena, Montana in 1891. The epithet stenosepalum means "narrow-sepalled", the primary difference between it and typical Trillium ovatum. As of April 2024, Trillium ovatum var. stenosepalum R. R. Gates is a synonym for Trillium ovatum var. ovatum, but recent evidence suggests the taxon may be a distinct species. Trillium ovatum f. maculosum Case & R. B. Case refers to a form with mottled leaves that occurs in Northern California. Its type specimen was collected in Mendocino County in 1996. It is the only reported instance of a pedicellate Trillium with mottled leaves. There is no evidence that f. maculosum is distinct from typical Trillium ovatum. The names Trillium ovatum f. hibbersonii T. M. C. Taylor & Szczaw. and Trillium ovatum var. hibbersonii (T. M. C. Taylor & Szczaw.) G. W. Douglas & Pojar are synonyms for Trillium hibbersonii (T. M. C. Taylor & Szczaw.) D. O'Neil & S. B. Farmer. Despite its provenance, Trillium hibbersonii is not related to Trillium ovatum, but rather it is a member of subgenus Trillium, the Trillium erectum group. Trillium ovatum sensu lato is the most widespread and abundant Trillium in Western North America. It ranges from Monterey County in Central California northward throughout the California coast ranges to Vancouver Island and Southwestern British Columbia. It also occurs in the Rocky Mountains from Southeastern British Columbia and the tip of Southwestern Alberta, Southward through Idaho, Eastern Washington and Northeastern Oregon, and Southeastward through Western Montana. There is a small, isolated population in Northern Colorado and Southern Wyoming. It is often found growing in coniferous and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests, in and around alder thickets and shrubs. Along the California coast, it is commonly found under Coast Redwood and mixed evergreen forest. At Lolo Pass, Montana, it grows under Spruce and Douglas Fir in ravines along mountain streams. It does not grow in the dry chaparral inland from the Redwood and Douglas Fir forests of California and Oregon, nor on ridges where the trees are sparse. Trillium ovatum var. oettingeri is endemic to a relatively small region in Northwestern California. It occurs primarily in the Salmon Mountains, a subrange of the Klamath Mountains, in Southwestern Siskiyou County, Northern Trinity County, and Northeastern Humboldt County. Smaller populations are known to occur in the Cascade Range east of Mount Shasta straddling the border between Siskiyou County and Shasta County. It is found growing at elevations from 4,000 – 6,300 feet (1,200 – 1,900 m), often in cold mountain streams, on the banks of mountain lakes, or at the base of cliffs where late summer snow patches linger. The distribution of Trillium ovatum var. stenosepalum is inconsistently reported in the literature. After examining specimens from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and California, Gates (1917) deduced that the taxon ranged from "western Montana and southern Washington to middle California (Santa Cruz Mountains)". More recently, Wayman et al. (2024) concluded that the taxon "occurs in the Rocky Mountains" of Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Colorado, with the caveat that "additional field and lab work are necessary". Flowers bloom late February in the southern part of its range, and in March or April elsewhere. Citizen science observations of flowering plants of this species peak during the first week of April. For comparison, when Trillium grandiflorum is fully open in Eastern North America, t. ovatum is already fading in Western North America. Apparently t. ovatum lacks sufficient winter hardiness to flourish east of the Continental Divide. The life-cycle stages of t. ovatum include a cotyledon stage, a one-leaf vegetative stage, a three-leaf vegetative (juvenile) stage, a three-leaf reproductive (flowering) stage, and a three-leaf nonflowering regressive stage. An example of the latter involves a transition from the three-leaf flowering stage to a three-leaf nonflowering regressive stage. Approximately one of every four reproductive plants regresses to a nonflowering state in any given year. Under the right conditions, individuals may undergo extended dormancy, that is, they may cease above-ground growth for one or more years. In Western Montana, dormancy was observed in all adult stage classes, with most plants returning to above-ground status in a year or two, although some plants exhibited dormancy for 3–5 years. In 2019, the global conservation status of Trillium ovatum was determined to be Secure (G5).

EVIDENCE:
Creeping plants can be both beautiful and useful in a garden. Here are some of our favorites Creeping plants fulfil several tasks in a garden. First and foremost, they provide the visually pleasing effect of tree undergrowth, flowerbeds, carpeting rockeries or overhanging elements on walls and various terrains. Groundcover plants are not only useful because they protect the soil from erosion and drying out, but they also prevent weeds from growing, and last but not least, they’re generally low-maintenance. This is why these plants are frequently used as an easy to care for alternative to lawns, as a functional slope stabilization plant or to cover open areas in gardens. The best creeping plants must meet several criteria: • They should be low, ground-cover perennials with creeping, not vining, growth. • Creeping plants should also be evergreens so they can perform their visual and functional roles throughout the year. • Creeping perennials should be hardy and low-maintenance. All of the creeping plants in our list meet these requirements, and are beautiful as well. Here you can find creeping plants suitable for both sunny and shady locations. 1. Creeping myrtle / periwinkle Vinca minor If you’re looking for an ideal creeping plant for your garden, don't overlook the creeping myrtle, which perfectly meets all the requirements for this type of plant. Creeping myrtle is evergreen, resistant to frost, wildlife and physical damage and it thrives in full sun as well as in partial shade. Periwinkle is distinguished by its lovely flowering at the turn of spring and summer. This creeping plant is so hardy and adaptable that it grows quickly and covers a large area with its dense growth. Periwinkle is considered an invasive species, so it needs to be kept under control and prevented from growing where you don't want it. Creeping myrtle is ideal for planting around tree trunks, on slopes and over walls where it will overhang. Hardiness: USDA 4 - 9 2. Creeping phlox Phlox stolonifera and Phlox subulata Creeping plants are usually chosen for the texture of their leaves, but creeping phlox is also a beautiful flowering plant. Few flowering plants can compete with the vibrant, spring-flowering carpets of this creeping perennial. That's why creeping phlox is often used as a rockery plant, balcony flower or undemanding perennial in flower beds. Creeping phlox comes in a wide range of flower colors (red, pink, white, blue, purple, multicolored...). Creeping phlox requires a sunny and dry location. It can easily withstand hot weather, and also frosts, pests and wildlife. This creeping perennial is semi-deciduous, so its needle-like leaf texture is attractive all year round. It is ideal for covering and stabilizing slopes and other exposed sites with all-day sun. Creeping phlox can spread over time without being an invasive plant. Hardiness: USDA 5 - 9 3. Japanese spurge Pachysandra terminalis Japanese spurge is an ideal evergreen creeping plant suitable for a shady spot in a garden. It has a wonderful texture all year round, with leaves that are broader, brighter and denser than those of most creeping plants. Japanese spurge is frost and wildlife resistant and can cope with dry soil, where it serves a water-retaining function. It also thrives in heavy clay soils, which are problematic for most plants. This creeping perennial likes partial shade or shade, and if given the right conditions, it can spread rapidly by root suckers, so it can also be an invasive plant if not kept under control. Japanese spurge also known as pachysandra is an excellent creeping plant around tree trunks, around walkways and in defined areas in the garden. Hardiness: USDA 4 - 8 4. Creeping juniper Juniperus horizontalis Conifers can also make great creeping plants. The creeping juniper is proof, as it does the job to perfection. This light-loving ground-cover conifer is virtually maintenance-free and very resistant to both frost and drought. All it needs is well-drained soil in a sunny location, and its growth can cover a large area over time. Creeping juniper grows to a maximum height of 45 cm (16 inches), but can spread up to 3 m (10 feet). Thanks to their strong root system, these creeping conifers can strengthen any slope, preventing erosion. Creeping juniper is an attractive coniferous plant that doesn’t die back even in winter, so it is often used as an evergreen foundation in garden design. It can be found in rockeries, front yards and in mixed plantings. Hardiness: USDA 3 - 9 5. Bugleweed Ajuga reptans If you want to quickly cover an area with low vegetation to prevent weed growth, bugleweed is a good choice. This creeping perennial is very hardy and adaptable, so it tends to grow quickly, forming dense carpets of green foliage. Like most creeping plants, bugleweed is invasive and therefore needs to be kept under control with pruning or edging. Bugleweed can withstand even the hardest frosts, does not attract wildlife, and can survive in full sun or partial shade. A bonus of growing bugleweed is its beautiful, distinctive flowers that appear on long stems. It blooms throughout the summer in shades of blue or purple, depending on the variety. Different varieties also offer different leaf coloring, including variegated combinations. Variegated bugleweed varieties, along with being visually striking, are a good option because they are less invasive. Hardiness: USDA 4 - 9 6. Blue spruce stonecrop Sedum reflexum There are hundreds of species of sedum, most of which are low-growing succulents that are well-suited for exposed rock habitats with plenty of sunshine. This makes them popular plants for rock gardens, green roofs and dry areas with all-day sun. In addition, some species of stonecrops are evergreen and hardy enough to make perfect creeping plants. Proof of this is the blue spruce stonecrop, which forms dense carpets that can cover any area that has dry soil and plenty of sun. The blue spruce stonecrop is hardy but not invasive, so maintenance is simple. A popular variety of blue spruce stonecrop is 'Angelina,' with its greenish-yellow needle-like leaves that turn orange as winter sets in. Hardiness: USDA 4 - 9 7. Creeping thyme Thymus spp. (Citriodorus, Serpyllum, Praecox and others) There are hundreds of species belonging to the genus Thymus, and some of them are excellent evergreen creeping perennials. One such species is Thymus citriodorus, or lemon thyme, which grows up to 10 cm (4 inches) and forms dense carpets that are covered with fragrant flowers during summer. Lemon thyme is considered a maintenance-free, non-invasive perennial, and it’s resistant to pests, frost and drought. Other thyme species (e.g. Thymus serpyllum, Thymus praecox and others) can also fulfill the role of creeping plants. These creeping perennials are ideal for covering areas between stepping stones as they release a strong scent when walked on. However, creeping thyme will do well in any sunny spot with dry, rocky soil. Hardiness: USDA 2 - 9 8. Bearberry Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Bearberry is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that makes an excellent ground cover. It grows up to 25 cm (10 inches) tall and can spread up to 2 m (7 feet) or more. It is interesting for its leathery, glossy leaves and red berries that resemble cranberries. This hardy creeping evergreen prefers dry, sandy or rocky soils and a sunny to semi-shaded location. It flowers in spring with tiny flowers, which then transform to red berries in late summer/early autumn, favored by birds. Bearberry is suitable for slopes as well as for planting along paths, under trees or in combination with other plants in beds. This woody plant spreads via runners, but does not grow as fast as other creeping plants. Hardiness: USDA 2 - 6 9. Wild ginger Asarum europaeum, Asarum canadense Few evergreen creeping plants are as distinctive as wild ginger. This perennial can also be found in temperate forests, where it often forms continuous undergrowth. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it can thrive even in the shadiest corners of gardens, where it can replace a lawn or be combined with other shade-loving plants. This shade-loving creeping plant is very attractive, with shiny, rounded, dark-green leaves that form dense carpets. Hardiness: USDA 3 - 7 10. Siberian cypress Microbiota decussate This creeping conifer is also known as the Russian arborvitae. Its relation to cypress conifers such as yews and cypresses is reflected in the shape and structure of its needles. This creeping conifer is ideal for filling space under trees or for stabilizing and covering shady slopes, where it creates a beautiful texture. Siberian cypress grows to a height of 45 cm (16 inches), but a single plant can cover up to 2 m (7 feet). The needles of this creeping plant are green during the growing season, but take on a beautiful bronze tint in the fall. Hardiness: USDA 2 - 8 There are many other types of creeping plants that we have not mentioned in our selection but are noteworthy as well: for example rock cotoneaster (Cotoneaster horizontalis), creeping charlie (Glechoma hederacea), creeping jenny (Lysimachia nummularia), evergreen candytuft (Iberis sempervirens), hellebore (Helleborus orientalis), wintercreeper euonymus (Euonymus fortunei), creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens), dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), wall germander (Teucrium chamaedrys), black mondo grass (Ophiopogon planiscapus), liriope muscari, Christmas fern (Polystichum acrostichoides) and many other creeping plants."

User > We have a Norfolk Island palm tree, and for many months, it has had new, recurring brown pine needles and dry branches. About a month ago, we treated the tree for spider mites by spraying the entire tree with a garden hose as well as with insecticidal soap. Although we never found spider mites on the tree, it had been adjacent to another plant that definitely had them. Now, the tree is still producing dried leaves and branches. We are requesting help on how to care for and treat our Norfolk Island palm tree. Some background information: our palm tree sits in a sunroom that is not climatized. It receives about 2 to 3 hours of morning sun every day. We used moisture-controlling soil and the pot includes a drainage hole; we water the plant every couple of days with copious amounts of water. The age of the tree is unknown, but we received it about a year and a half ago. Although there are dying branches and pine needles, the top of the tree is growing upward as seen in the picture.

Title: Why are all these bugs appearing on the side or inside of my home? - Gardening in Michigan
colored asian lady beetles are beetles ( coleoptera ), not true bugs. asian lady beetles can bite but cannot spread disease. they also emit defensive secretions that have a slight odor, can stain fabrics and in rare cases have been known to cause allergic reactions. what causes these insects to aggregate? the summer months are a time when insects are active in gardens, trees or shrubs. as daylight lessens, insects undergo a physiological change known as diapause. this is characterized by an extended time of inactivity during which they do not reproduce and eat little or nothing. in their natural habitat, these insects spend winter beneath bark. stink bugs begin to aggregate on the sides of buildings and structures when there is less than 12. 5 hours of daylight, approximately the second or third week of september in michigan. south and west facing walls are most susceptible to large populations. they particularly move towards garages, sheds and sidings with small spaces or gaps that are protected from the weather. for several weeks in the fall, stink bugs and other aggregating insects may attempt to enter homes in search of a winter environment protected from moisture and cooler air temperatures. how can i keep them out of my home? during fall, search for spots on the outside of the house with gaps that are wide enough for insects to enter. these areas can be covered with wire mesh, screens or caulk. window air conditioning units should be checked for gaps and covered. when there are hundreds of swarming insects on the outside of a home, leave the windows closed or check for gaps in the screen. a strong force of water can knock insects off exterior walls. on homes with severe outbreaks, a pyrethroid insecticide can be applied to the foundation or siding. this will only kill insects that contact the insecticide and is not an effective long - term strategy. since these fall - invading insects can fly up to several miles, it is likely more will return on the next warm day. when smaller numbers are present inside or outside, the insects can be knocked into a bucket of soapy water, vacuumed up or just left alone. what can i do once they get inside? the best way to control indoor nuisance pests is through removal or exclusion. inside homes, stink bugs are attracted to light and may fly towards light fixtures, resulting in an annoying buzz. a homemade light trap with light shined into a foil pan containing unscented dish soap and water can provide relief at killing stink bugs already inside the home ( photo 3 ). it is not recommended to apply insecticides to overwintering insects that are already inside your home. the chemicals will only kill insects that make direct contact and will not prevent additional insects from finding their way inside. when hundreds of stink bugs are found in the home or shed, they can be vacuumed with a shop - vac. on warmer winter days, a stray stink bug or two may emerge from diapause and walk or fly around the house. by this time, all overwintered insects are already inside a home, and hand - picking is the easiest way to eliminate them.

Title: Norfolk Island Pine: Plant Care & Growing Guide
your tree's soil ph and amend for acidic soil. norfolk island pines are capable of growing both indoors and outdoors. while they have preferred growing conditions, they are quite forgiving and can thrive in various settings. credit : the spruce / kortney gloska credit : the spruce / kortney gloska credit : the spruce / kortney gloska light a norfolk island pine needs sun, preferring full sun whenever possible. a south - facing window is ideal. norfolk island pines can also handle relatively long periods ( months at a time ) in dimmer conditions. you can keep your potted plant indoors during the winter and then move it to a sunny spot outdoors when the summer comes around. if your plant begins to stretch while growing inside, the odds are that the combination of low light and heavy fertilizer is causing leggy growth. in that case, cut back on the fertilizer until the plant has more access to sunlight. it's helpful to turn it frequently, so every side gets equal light. soil if growing norfolk island pine indoors, use a potting mix that is porous, sandy, and slightly acidic. adding extra peat moss and sand to a standard potting mix will improve acidity and porosity. grown outside, it prefers soil that is rich, sandy, and acidic. these are acid - loving plants, preferring a ph in the 4. 5 to 5. 5 range. you can check your soil ph with an easy - to - do test, which will help keep your tree happy and healthy for a long time. water water your norfolk island pine regularly, keeping the soil damp but not soggy. indoors, it should be watered every one to two weeks, until excess moisture starts draining out of the bottom of the pot. outdoor norfolk pine trees prefer the soil to remain somewhat moist. once established, it will tolerate somewhat dry conditions. temperature and humidity because they are native to the south pacific, norfolk island pines prefer warmer, wetter climates between 65°f and 70°f. they can briefly survive cooler and warmer temperatures but may perish if they experience temperatures below 35°f. if you want to give your norfolk pine some extra love, use a humidifier to help increase the humidify around the plant. fertilizer feed your norfolk island pine with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season ( the spring and summer months ). a 20 - 20 - 20 npk formulation will work fine, but a fertilizer specifically formulated for conifers or azaleas will give it the boost of added acidity that it loves so much. norfolk island pines — especially younger trees — have notoriously weak root systems. to strengthen their roots, make sure you're supplying regular fertilizer, and don't hesitate to stake your tree up if it needs support. potting and repotting norfolk island pines a potted norfolk island pine only needs to be repotted when it's rootbound or the roots are beginning to come out of the drainage hole. young norfolk island pines are not very fast growers, so you'll likely only need to repot it every few years. repot your norfolk island pine in the springtime. choose a heavy pot to help keep the tree from falling over. make sure the pot is only a couple of inches larger than the one the plant is coming from, with plenty of drainage holes. types of norfolk island pines there is only one variety of norfolk island pine on the market : araucaria heterophylla. there are no other types of norfolk island pine ; there are no cultivars or named varieties. a few other species from this family sometimes show up in the trade, mislabeled as the original plant. these include a. columnaris, a. araucana, and a. bidwillii. it's unlikely you'll see these, but if you happen to acquire one, the care requirements are similar. pruning remove the lower branches that have died. it is usually not recommended to trim the top of a norfolk island pine, but if a potted tree gets too large for its space, cut off the central leader. if it does get new growth, the new growth will branch out, which will cause the tree to lose its classic evergreen look, but it will help the tree to stay shorter. remove dead and diseased branches from trees grown outdoors, but other than this, no routine pruning is necessary. how to grow norfolk island pine from seed norfolk island pine best propagates by seed. collect the seeds. break apart the spherical cones after they fall from the tree to remove the seeds. plant them soon after. place seeds on soil. place seeds flat on the soil surface in a container at least 12 inches deep. the ideal soil mix is a moist, peaty, sandy mix. don't cover the seeds with soil. mist and wait. mist the seeds to encourage germination, which should occur in 10 to 15 days. set pot in bright, indirect light. place the pot in a spot that gets bright, indirect light. if growing outdoors, choose a location that gets partial sun, with only three to four hours of direct sun. care for as usual after germination. a tap root and top growth are signs the seed has germinated. once the seedlings have a tap root and growth, keep the soil moist and care for as usual. tip do not attempt to propagate a norfolk island pine by taking a cutting ; it is not recommended since new growth does not grow back in its place like other plants. overwintering norfolk pines can't tolerate temperatures below 35°f. in winter, bring potted norfolk pine trees indoors ( if it's not already ). place it in a room with average or high humidity and full, bright sunlight ( a bright bathroom would be ideal ). water only when the surface of the soil is dry to the touch. can you put a norfolk island pine outside? yes, you can put a norfolk pine outside if outdoor temperatures are consistently above 65°f ( ideally above 75°f ) like it would be in its native area in the south pacific. it cannot survive in temperatures lower than 35°f. common pests & plant diseases norfolk island pines are vulnerable to pests including aphids, mealybugs, scale, mites, and whiteflies. identify and treat the infestation as early as possible. a norfolk island pine may also develop a fungal disease from overwatering, such as anthracnose, which can turn entire sections of the tree yellow, brown, and then cause the plant to die. norfolk island pines conservation in its native habitats in the southern pacific ocean, norfolk island pine is considered a vulnerable species by the international union for conservation of nature. however, that is completely separate from the houseplant trade. norfolk island pine is commonly sold as a houseplant, and that has not impacted the plant's status as a threatened species in its native area. common problems with norfolk island pines this easy - going tree may encounter a few challenges in its life. the needles will turn different colors to alert you to a problem. needles turning brown norfolk island pine does best in moderate temperatures ; it doesn't tolerate cold or heat well. wide temperature fluctuations can cause the needles to brown. needles that are turning brown may also indicate that the plant is being overwatered or underwatered. needles turning yellow if the needles turn yellow, the tree is either getting too much or not enough sunlight. assess the light the tree is getting and make an adjustment so it's either getting less or more. extreme changes in temperature may also be the culprit turning the needles yellow. check the area for any vents that might have started coming on. needles dropping needles will drop for two reasons : your tree is either being overwatered or it's not given enough light. assess how much light the tree has and how much water it's getting and adjust accordingly. drooping branches the first thing to check when your norfolk island pine's branches go droopy is the soil — it's likely too dry. if more than a quarter of the depth of the pot is dry, give the plant a deep watering. set it in a bathtub or shower and slowly pour room temperature water at the base of the plant until it runs out through the drainage holes. if the soil is so compacted that the water runs around it and down the perimeter of the pot, gently aerate the soil with a wooden dowel then water. plants you might also like how to care for a fiddle leaf fig and keep it thriving how to grow and care for weeping fig how to grow and care for yucca plants how to grow and care for a money tree how to grow and care for bay laurel 1 of 5 faq are norfolk island pine trees easy to care for? norfolk island pine trees are easy to care for indoors or outdoors, as long as they are not in dry conditions. supplemental humidity ( like from a humidifier ) will help them thrive. can you plant a norfolk island pine in your yard? you can only plant a norfolk island pine in your yard if you live in usda hardiness zones 10 or 11. in any lower hardiness zone, it will be too cold for the plant to survive winter. where should i place my norfolk island pine in my house? place your norfolk island pine in a location that receives bright, sunny conditions and is away from any cold drafts. what is the lifespan of a norfolk island pine? when grown indoors, a norfolk island pine has a lifespan of several decades. if the tree is planted outside, it has a lifespan of more than 150 years. should you mist a norfolk pine? no, you should not mist a norfolk pine. misting is completely ineffective at raising the humidity for plants. if you think your norfolk pine would benefit from increased humidity, get it a humidifier. how do i bring a dying norfolk island pine back to life? to bring a dying norfolk island pine back to life, first check the soil. if it's dry, aerate the soil by poking holes in it, then water it deeply. set it outside and run the hose on it for several minutes or place it in the sink and run it under the water for a few minutes. the soil should be thoroughly wetted. however, if the plant is dying and the soil is dry, check for root rot and treat. explore more : gardening plants & flowers trees sources the spruce uses only high - quality sources, including peer - reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles. read our editorial process to learn more about how we fact - check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. norfolk island pine. pennstate extension. norfolk island pine. university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences. insect issues norfolk island pines. city of oxnard. norfolk island pine. iucn red list newsletter sign up newsletter sign up by clicking “ accept all cookies ”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts. cookies settings accept all cookies"

User > In Northeast DC, I moved into a house last August and inherited about a dozen different rosebushes. I’ve encountered a few issues with them: 1. One very small one in the front yard (possibly a Knock Out) looks like it may have rose rosette. I unknowingly pruned off the shriveled red foliage while deadheading. Could it be rosette? Should I remove the bush or did I risk spreading it to the adjacent bush after pruning? 2. In the backyard, three unknown variety bushes behaved differently. The large one bloomed well even when neglected, but the other two stopped blooming and lost foliage after an aphid treatment. The leaves also have dark spots—is it black spot? The re-emerging blossoms and leaves have bare stems and dark spots. Is the webbing a sign of pest or beneficial insects? Should I remove discolored leaves or webbing, or prune any bare stems now or in winter?

Title: What Causes Begonia Leaves to Curl? (and What to Do About It)
begonias are available in an astonishing variety of leaf shapes. some look like angel wings, others resemble ferns, and there are even some that curl and twist – almost like a snail shell. the latter is the good kind of curling begonia leaf. then there ’ s the bad kind of leaf curl. we link to vendors to help you find relevant products. if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. begonia leaves might curl up or down, horizontally, or vertically along the center, as a result of some kind of stressor. in this guide, we ’ ll chat about what causes this type of abnormal leaf growth and what you can do about it, whether it ’ s affecting a pretty wax type in your garden or a striking angel - wing houseplant that ’ s got curling leaves. here ’ s what i ’ ll cover : causes of begonia leaf curl if you ’ re not sure whether your specimen is a type that is supposed to have curling leaves, read our guide to classifying begonias using the leaves and stems. the first problem we ’ ll look at is one caused by caring too much. yes, it ’ s possible to be an overly attentive plant parent. 1. excess fertilizer whether you ’ re growing your begonias inside or out, they all need mild, balanced, all - purpose fertilizer. when the plants receive too much food, salts can build up in the soil and the begonias may react by twisting and curling the leaves upwards, among other symptoms. outdoor flowering plants should be fertilized once a month, starting just before they flower and continuing until they are finished blooming. begonias grown as houseplants should be fed every other month from early spring through fall. don ’ t be tempted to add too much or fertilize too often. indoors, i like to use dr. earth house plant pump and grow. it has an npk ratio of 1 - 1 - 1 and is made out of recycled organic food scraps discarded from grocery stores. dr. earth house plant pump and grow a 16 - ounce bottle with a convenient pump top is available at arbico organics. for outdoor begonias, down to earth makes a nice option called a “ vegan mix, ” which has an npk ratio of 3 - 2 - 2 and is made of soybean, alfalfa, and kelp meal, along with rock phosphate and greensand. pick up five pounds of the good stuff in a compostable box at arbico organics. even if you ’ re fertilizing on the correct schedule with the right food, it ’ s still possible to overfeed. for outdoor begonias, you should be testing your soil regularly. maybe your soil is naturally rich in potassium and here you are adding extra on top of that, for example. many plants will simply not absorb more than they need, but when there ’ s far too much, it can burn the roots and cause curled leaves. if you ’ re growing your begonias outdoors and you notice curling leaves, look at other nearby plants of different species. do they have curled leaves, too? or perhaps their foliage is wilting and yellowing? if so, it ’ s highly probable that they ’ ve suffered herbicide injury. even if you didn ’ t apply herbicides in your own garden, it ’ s
Title: Volutella Blight of Pachysandra
leaf spots on pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra collapse of pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra blighted leaf on pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra leaf spot beginning on pachysandra ( pachysandra ) caused by volutella blight of pachysandra leaf blight, volutella pachysandricola, on japanese pachysandra can be very detrimental to the plant. two other leaf spots, phyllosticta and gloeosporium, cause leaf spots on foliage but are not as destructive as volutella. ground covers, such as pachysandra, are sometimes used where grass or other plants will not grow due to low light. consequently, the environmental stress factors, including prolonged leaf wetness or dry soils, can favor certain infectious diseases in the sites. symptoms and diagnosis volutella blight begins as small, brown to tan spots on the leaves that enlarge to form blotches. these blotches can then spread and coalesce to form a blight where young growing tissue, especially leaves and twigs, are killed. concentric line patterns form within the brown spots as leaves yellow and fall. infected stems become brown to black in color and die. circular, spreading areas on diseased plants will be noticeable in the planting. the disease will be especially severe when plants are crowded and wet conditions prevail. many spore masses cause the spread of the disease, which is especially rapid among plants that have been weakened by the attack of scale insects or by winter injury. the sexual stage of this fungus is pseudonectria pachysandricola. under moist conditions, salmon - to pink - colored masses of fungal spores form on the surface of dead stems in spring. initial infections may lead to large patches of plants killed. integrated pest management strategies 1. maintain plant vigor. purchase healthy plants and maintain this condition by watering during drought. water early in the day so that drying occurs before evening. avoid splashing of water. fertilize as needed or as indicated by soil testing. 2. select planting area carefully. plants should be planted in a well - draining soil. if the site is persistently wet, amend the soil or raise the bed before planting. 3. removal. lift out and destroy severely diseased plants. bury or remove from the site. do not place in the compost pile. 4. use fungicides. it is difficult to thoroughly apply fungicides unless using a forceful sprayer. fungicides can be applied beginning in spring and at 7 to 14 day intervals through early summer. once temperatures rise above 90of, discontinue application. pesticides registered for use include chlorothalonil, copper, mancozeb, and thiophanate methyl. 5. mulch. mulch with leaf mold in the spring to cover up fallen debris containing inoculum. 6. thinning. thin plants in fall, during dry weather, to remove dense growth. 7. pests. scale is a harmful pest on pachysandra and may make it more susceptible to disease. the female insects are dark brown and shaped like oyster shells. the males are smaller and narrower, pure
Title: Volutella Blight – Wisconsin Horticulture
what is volutella blight? volutella blight is a common and potentially lethal disease of japanese pachysandra ( pachysandra terminalis ), an evergreen, semi - woody groundcover that is grown in shade gardens throughout hardiness zones 4 and 5 in wisconsin. volutella blight can severely limit the aesthetic appeal of pachysandra wherever it is grown. what does volutella blight look like? volutella blight begins as discrete, water - soaked areas ( lesions ) on pachysandra leaves and stems that eventually turn black / brown and become necrotic ( i. e., die ). lesions can be circular, oval or irregular in shape, and may have darker margins. distinct concentric rings also may be visible in the lesions. lesions on a single leaf can merge and cause the collapse of the entire leaf, while stem lesions can lead to the collapse of an entire pachysandra plant. when severe, volutella blight can kill large patches of a pachysandra planting. where does volutella blight come from? volutella blight is caused by the fungus volutella pachysandricola which survives in infected plants, as well as on and in pachysandra plant debris. during wet weather, this fungus produces masses of light - orange to pink fungal spores and hyphae ( i. e., fungal threads ) that may be visible to the naked eye. how do i save a plant with volutella blight? remove diseased leaves, as well as any leaf debris, and prune back or dig up plants with stem infections. dispose of this material by burning ( where allowed by local ordinance ), burying or hot composting it. be sure to prune only when plants are dry to minimize the spread of the causal fungus. be sure to clean your pruning tools between cuts by treating them for at least 30 seconds in a 10 % bleach solution or ( preferably due its less corrosive properties ) 70 % alcohol ( e. g., rubbing alcohol, certain spray disinfectants ). if you use bleach, be sure to thoroughly rinse and oil tools after you are done pruning to prevent rusting. when disease is severe, follow leaf and plant removal by treating remaining plants with one or more applications of a broad - spectrum fungicide ( e. g., one containing chlorothalonil ). select a product that is labeled for use on pachysandra, and follow all label instructions to ensure that you apply the product in the safest and most effective way possible. how do i avoid problems with volutella blight in the future? v. pachysandricola is a somewhat opportunistic pathogen, most often causing problems on pachysandra that is weakened or under stress. therefore, reduce any stresses where possible. reduce stress due to overexposure to sun by always planting pachysandra in a shady area. do not overcrowd new plantings, and thin existing beds to not only reduce stress from competition but also to promote good air flow and rapid drying of plants. dry plants are less likely to become infected than plants that stay wet for extended periods. to prevent water stress during the summer and reduce winter injury over the winter, established pachysandra should receive approximately one inch of

Title: How To Grow And Care For Paper Bush (Edgeworthia Chrysantha)
feet of space so it has room to grow. young shrubs don't require any pruning except to remove dead or diseased foliage. as paper bush plants mature, the shrub produces plant suckers, an unintended branch, or new growth that adds more stress to the plant. prune plant suckers away from the primary branch structure. keeping paper bush plants healthy as they are established will help promote better results in the future. if pruning to adjust the plant's shape or appearance, wait until after blooming to remove branches. summer isn't a downtime for the paper bush. after it finishes blooming, it cloaks itself with very handsome foliage reminiscent of plumeria. long, narrow, leathery, blue - green leaves up to 10 inches long give the shrub a tropical look. propagating paper bush plants while your paper bush may set seed in the spring, germination is difficult and can take a year or longer. the easiest way to propagate paper bush plants is by replanting suckers when you prune, making sure to preserve roots on the suckers. but you can also propagate with cuttings in the summer. here's how to propagate the paper bush plant with stem cuttings : select woody and semi - ripe nodal stems to cut using pruning shears or a sharp knife. remove leaves on the lower 2 / 3 of the stems, then dip the tip in rooting hormone powder. add cutting to a well - watered container filled with organically - rich soil. gently pack the cuttings, ensuring the entire bottom of the selection is below the top of the soil. place in indirect sunlight and new roots should emerge within weeks. potting and repotting paper bush paper bush is a large plant that may quickly outgrow containers, so it's best planted in the ground. but you can grow it in a pot initially or if you live in a climate that is outside of its hardiness range. use a large container with drainage holes and fill with organically rich, well - draining potting mix. plant so that the root ball is level with the top of the soil, then water well. overwintering adding a layer of organic mulch can protect the plant's roots and help retain moisture. consider placing the plant along a south or west - facing wall to protect against frost and frigid winter winds. if you decide to plant your paper bush in a container, move it to a protected area in winter that isn't subjected to severe cold. the ground provides insulation that containers cannot. consider using row covers or frost blankets to protect your paper bush during unexpected cold snaps. positioning your plant near buildings or using windbreaks can also help shield it from harsh winds. common pests & plant diseases this easy - to - maintain shrub does not have many pest or disease issues. occasionally, paper bush plants are susceptible to earwigs when the soil becomes too damp. spray soap and water solution to get rid of the infestation. other issues include root rot - related issues from using poorly draining soil. leaf curl or drop occurs when plants are over - or under - watered. ensure your paper bush is planted in well - draining soil to avoid root rot, which can occur if the soil remains too wet. how to get paper bush to bloom although it's an attractive plant throughout the year, paper bush, a perennial, starts to shine in late fall. drooping, rounded flower buds covered with silky, silvery hairs appear on top of naked stems. when sunlight hits the buds, the paper bush seems to bloom already. the flower buds grow in size and prominence all winter. then, in late winter, they pop open to reveal pendant clusters of dainty white tubular blooms on the outside, tipped with yellow. the sweet fragrance reminds you that paper bush is kin to winter daphne ( but it's much easier to grow ). flowering can last four to six weeks. the more sunlight exposure, the more blooms — just make sure to keep the plant hydrated. you do not need to deadhead these flowers. common problems with paper bush plants curling leaves leaf curl occurs when paper bush plants are over - watered or under - watered. amend soil with organic materials to help encourage proper water drainage. water more frequently in the summer. leaves turning yellow yellowing leaves often signify a nutrient imbalance. lack of nitrogen in the soil can cause leaves to turn yellow, then white, starting at the bottom of the plant and moving toward the top. stems may appear more spindly if the problem persists. another reason for yellowing leaves is insufficient airflow. give plants enough space, and plant them in a manageable amount of space. frequently asked questions how long can paper bush live? with proper care, the paper bush is a perennial plant that can continue to grow for decades. where should i place my paper bush plant? paper bushes should be placed in an area where they will get full to partial sun and in acidic, loamy, moist yet well - drained soil. make sure to plant your paper bush where you can enjoy its flowers'fragrance. where did the botanical name edgeworthia chrysantha come from? the paper bush was named by an irish botanist named michael pakenham edgeworth and maria edgeworth, his half - sister. they chose the name \\\" chrysantha \\\" as it means golden flowers. explore more : gardening ideas outdoor plants shrubs & bushes was this page helpful?

Title: Diamondback Moth / Cole Crops / Agriculture: Pest Management Guidelines / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)
diamondback moth larvae ( caterpillars ) grow to be up to 0. 3 inch long. they are wider in the middle and taper at both ends. the two prolegs on the last segment form a distinctive v - shape at the rear end. when disturbed, the caterpillars wriggle rapidly or attach themselves to a leaf by a silken thread and drop off, similar to the behavior of leafroller caterpillars. mature diamondback moth caterpillars are smaller than other caterpillars that are common in cole crops. the caterpillars mature in 10 to 14 days during warm weather and spin a loose cocoon and pupate on leaves or stems. female adults ( moths ) lay tiny, roundish eggs singly on the undersides of leaves. eggs are difficult to find. diamondback moth may be active throughout the year, especially in coastal areas. the pest is most numerous in spring to early summer and in the fall. larvae feed mostly on outer or older leaves of plants. young stages rasp the undersides of the leaves, creating damage with a characteristic \\\" window paning \\\" appearance, in which the upper surface of the leaf remains intact and becomes transparent. older larvae chew small holes or feed at the growing points of young plants and chew floral stalks and flower buds. diamondback moth infestations are most serious when they damage the crowns or growing points of young plants or brussels sprouts. this injury can severely stunt growth. sometimes the caterpillars bore into flower buds or broccoli and cauliflower heads, causing contamination and economic injury. injury to leaves alone is not usually serious, except when the wrapper or cap leaves of cabbage are injured. keep records of diamondback moth while monitoring for other caterpillars. natural enemies and insecticides applied to control other pests might keep the diamondback moth under control in most fields in california. keep in mind that broad - spectrum pesticides applied for other pests can sometimes increase diamondback moth infestations by eliminating natural enemies. rotate out of cole crops so that they do not grow in the same field in consecutive years. plant all cole crops in a given field at the same time, rather than staggering planting dates between adjacent blocks of the same field. blocks with differently aged cole crops enable diamondback moth to move through the field and cause sustained, continuous damage. natural enemies often control diamondback moth in california. in southern california, an ichneumonid wasp, diadegma insularis, is the most common parasitic wasp that attacks diamondback moth. trichogramma pretiosum, another type of parasitic wasp, may also attack the moth eggs. predators such as ground beetles, spiders, syrphid fly larvae, and true bugs can also play an important role in biological control of diamondback moth. naturally occurring microbial diseases are not known to effectively control this pest. consider planting insectary plants to attract natural enemies of diamondback moth. organically acceptable methods use biological control in an organically certified crop, as well as sprays of bacillus thuringiensis and the entrust sc formulation of spinosad. monitoring and treatment decisions twice per week during the following periods, sample fields for caterpillars and record the number of diamondback moth larvae separately from other species : during the seedling stage or right after transplanting, just before heading. in cabbage, regularly monitor wrapper leaves for damage after heading. adults frequently migrate in from fields being harvested or disced, so carefully check border rows if numbers were high in adjacent fields. no economic thresholds have been developed for diamondback moth in california. insecticide application may be necessary if there is significant feeding on growing points. diamondback moth has developed resistance to multiple insecticides with different modes of action. therefore, it is especially important to rotate insecticide modes of action to manage this pest. do not apply more than two insecticides with the same mode of action within a 10 - to 14 - day period. treatment table updated : 12 / 20"

Title: Why Are My Wax Begonia Leaves Curling? – Cafe Planta
leaves. if you ’ re growing your begonias outdoors and you notice curling leaves, look at other nearby plants of different species. do they have curled leaves, too? or perhaps their foliage is wilting and yellowing? if so, it ’ s highly probable that they ’ ve suffered herbicide injury. even if you didn ’ t apply herbicides in your own garden, it ’ s possible that some wafted over from a neighbor or maybe your local government applied herbicides to public areas nearby. or perhaps you recently treated your lawn? you might wonder if what you are seeing is a result of a pest or disease issue. typically, specific pests or diseases stick to plants in the same genus or family. powdery mildew in legumes, for example, is caused by microsphaera diffusa while in begonias it ’ s caused by oidium begoniae. but if totally unrelated species are symptomatic, the cause is usually something else like a watering issue or herbicide damage. so, if your begonias and nearby hostas are both showing symptoms of leaf curl, it ’ s probably not a pest or disease issue since the plants are from different genera. if you suspect herbicides are the problem, there ’ s not much to do except find where they came from and stop it from happening again. 3. mealybugs or scale sapsuckers like mealybugs and scale cause stress to the begonia, and this stress can result in curling leaves. both scale and mealybugs are fairly easy to identify once you know what to look for. both are oval and flat, and either brown, tan, black, or white with a waxy coating. they like to hang out on the stems and at the leaf joints, so look closely in those areas. these pests don ’ t move much, and they tend to cluster together, so people sometimes mistake them for symptoms of a disease. but try scraping them off and squishing them – if they come off easily or they can be smashed, they are bugs, not symptoms of a disease. i know, gross. if scale or mealybugs are the cause of the leaf curl, you can simply scrape them off the plant using a butter knife or dab them with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. broad, tropical, or begonia mites ( polyphagotarsonemus latus ) are an invisible monster. they ’ re about 0. 02 millimeters in length, so you won ’ t be able to see them with the naked eye. these pests thrive in the same conditions as begonias, namely warm and humid. you ’ ll find them all over in greenhouses and tropical areas and they feed on many warm - weather species. when the mites feed on the plant, they cause the terminal leaves to curl and roll. they can also cause deformed buds and stunted growth. you can get out a magnifying glass and examine the begonias closely to try and see the mites. they like to hide in areas that are shaded and hidden. if you see them or even suspect an infestation, treat the plant with insecticidal soap. spray once a week with the soap on a day when there is no rain expected if your plants are outside. insecticidal soap is handy to have around since it tackles many insect problems

s closely to try and see the mites. they like to hide in areas that are shaded and hidden. if you see them or even suspect an infestation, treat the plant with insecticidal soap. spray once a week with the soap on a day when there is no rain expected if your plants are outside. insecticidal soap is handy to have around since it tackles many insect problems. grab some bonide super soap in quart - sized ready - to - use containers at arbico organics. most of the time, if you don ’ t give your plants the moisture they need, they wilt. but chronic underwatering causes curling and leaf browning along the margins in many begonia species. most commonly cultivated begonias do best when the soil is kept consistently moist and not allowed to dry out completely or get too wet. usually, over - or underwatering once or twice isn ’ t the end of the world, but if it happens repeatedly, it really starts to stress the plant and can cause leaf curling and stunted growth. guess what the solution is? give your plants the right amount of water! if you grab a bit of soil and roll it in your hand, it should just hold together for a minute before it falls apart. if it crumbles immediately, it ’ s too dry. if it sticks together and water squeezes out, it ’ s too wet. it ’ s easier for me to just envision the texture of a well - wrung - out sponge. that ’ s what the soil should feel like. as with excess fertilizer, overwatering is a helicopter plant - parent problem. it ’ s more commonly seen in potted plants, but it can happen with plants in the ground, as well. overwatering once won ’ t cause too much trouble. but when it happens over and over, the leaves on your begonias might start to curl and turn brown. this happens because the roots underground are essentially drowning. they can ’ t access enough oxygen and the whole plant is stressed. reduce the amount of water you ’ re offering by half and give the plant some time to recover. if your plants are growing in containers, check to make sure the soil is draining well and the drainage holes aren ’ t clogged. if they are growing in the ground, consider how much water you ’ re providing based on how well your soil drains. you shouldn ’ t be adding water more frequently if the soil isn ’ t draining sufficiently. many viruses attack begonias. impatiens necrotic spot ( insv ), tobacco ringspot ( trsv ), broad bean wilt ( bbwv ), cucumber mosaic ( cmv ), tobacco necrosis virus ( tnv ) are all possibilities. all of them cause discoloration and malformed growth that can include curled leaves. look for angular yellow patches, distorted growth, and curled leaves. don ’ t worry about the specifics. it doesn ’ t really matter which virus your plant is infected with. if it ’ s sick, the only thing you can do is toss it. otherwise, you risk the virus spreading to other specimens via insects like aphids and thrips, and these viruses attack many, many species. plus, there is no cure. don ’ t curl up and die curls in your hair or your fries are a good thing. curling begonia leaves are usually a bad

you notice any signs of infection, take action quickly to avoid further damage. nutritional deficiencies : feeding your plant right just like us, plants need a balanced diet to thrive. nutritional deficiencies can lead to a variety of problems, including leaf curling in wax begonias. nitrogen deficiency : a lack of nitrogen can cause older leaves to turn yellow and curl. providing a balanced fertilizer during the growing season can help address this issue. potassium deficiency : this can result in leaf edge curling and browning. a fertilizer with a higher potassium content can remedy the deficiency. wax begonias generally benefit from a balanced, water - soluble fertilizer applied every 4 - 6 weeks during the growing season. be sure not to over - fertilize, as this can lead to salt build - up in the soil, which can also stress your plant. repotting and soil issues sometimes, leaf curling can be related to issues with the soil or the pot itself. ensuring your wax begonia has the right environment to grow is crucial for its health. soil quality : wax begonias prefer well - draining soil. if the soil retains too much moisture, it can lead to root problems and leaf curling. consider using a potting mix designed for houseplants, which typically contains a blend of peat, perlite, and vermiculite to ensure good drainage. pot size : over time, your begonia may outgrow its pot, leading to root - bound conditions. when this happens, the roots don't have enough space to spread out, which can stress the plant and cause leaf curling. repotting your plant into a slightly larger pot every couple of years can help. when repotting, gently loosen the roots and remove any dead or rotting sections. this will give your wax begonia a fresh start and encourage healthy growth. stress from transplanting or environmental changes wax begonias can be sensitive to changes in their environment. if you've recently moved or transplanted your plant, it might be experiencing stress, leading to leaf curling. transplant shock : after repotting, it's common for plants to go through a period of adjustment. this shock can cause leaves to curl temporarily as the plant acclimates to its new surroundings. environmental changes : moving your plant to a different location with different light or temperature conditions can also result in stress. gradually acclimating your plant to a new environment can help minimize the impact. give your wax begonia some time to adjust, and continue providing consistent care. it should bounce back once it's settled into its new home. humidity levels : keeping the air moist humidity is an often overlooked factor in plant care, yet it's crucial for wax begonias. these plants hail from tropical regions and appreciate a bit of moisture in the air. low humidity : in dry environments, especially during winter when indoor heating is on, the lack of humidity can cause leaves to curl. to raise humidity levels, consider misting your plant regularly, placing a humidifier nearby, or setting your plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water. high humidity : on the flip side, excessive humidity can encourage diseases like powdery mildew. ensuring good air circulation and keeping the leaves dry can help prevent these issues. monitoring the humidity levels in your home and making adjustments as needed can create a more comfortable environment for your wax begonia. leaf curling in wax begonias can stem from a variety of causes", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 1, "source_id": "a2ab8391952244d2", "page": -1, "url": "https://cafeplanta.com/a/blog/why-are-my-wax-begonia-leaves-curling", "content_hash": "a49e7cb82e9b8f777535340211cb9dd6026a5c04fe0a51f7bf47e60a644c8529", "month_year": "NULL", "source_type": "web", "title": "Why Are My Wax Begonia Leaves Curling? – Cafe Planta", "location": "NULL", "language": "en"}}

Title: Need ideas to eliminate dirt/mud along fence line. | Hometalk
Need ideas to eliminate dirt/mud along fence line.
Naomie Moore aka baileyanddaisey, Castaic CA on Feb 18, 2018
My vote is to lay a couple layers of landscape fabric then top with gravel, river rock or decorative rock of your choice.
Nancy Turner on Feb 19, 2018
I would go with pavers of some type. If the dogs run the fence line frequently, they may cause gravel or rock to fly all over the place in the yard when they are running. You could put down cement and lay some rock in it if you want that kind of look. My parents had a large patio made like that, and it lasted for years, if a rock came loose, my dad just put it back in, not sure what he used to keep it in, that was too many years ago.
Diane Dudley Vaughan Polsby on Feb 19, 2018
We have that problem with deer and mud. We solve it every year by spreading a think layer of cedar or pine shavings available from Tractor Supply.
Janice on Feb 19, 2018
Perhaps do something permanent, if you plan to stay there for the long-term. As suggested by others laying concrete pavers would be a good solution or maybe even consider drawing out a plan and having a sidewalk poured where they repeatedly run.....otherwise you'll continue just making-do and never resolve the real issue. Sometime it's best to just go ahead, though it may be an expense you didn't count on, to get it done correctly and spare yourself much frustration.
Iris on Feb 28, 2018
Thanks so much for the suggestions! Don’t want to put any kind of rocks in the yard as it’s a large grass lawn that needs regular cutting. I’ve had bad experiences with rocks and lawn movers! Has anyone tried crushed limestone? I think I know what that is but would like to see if someone had any experience with it.
Dianacirce70 on Feb 28, 2018
You can try river rock, its fairly cheap, and won't tend to scatter too bad
Loretta Wells on Nov 21, 2019
I am having the same problem. I am thinking of putting down sand along the fence line...I believe my mowers used herbicide to prevent trimming as I only have a tiny dog that is only out for short time..but gets muddy feet from the fence line...so looking for solutions same as you"

and moist, fertile, acidic, well - drained soil containing lots of organic material. water regularly during summer and fall to keep the soil consistently moist, and water during summer droughts. it has no serious pests, and pruning is seldom required, but do so to remove damaged or diseased branches. paper bush spreads by rhizomes but isn't invasive and generally forms a dense, slowly expanding clump of long, pliable stems. cuttings root easily in moist soil. the rapidly growing paper bush can grow to 7 or 8 feet tall and wide, depending on the selection. take cuttings to display indoors in winter. keep its fragrant blooms nearby using the plant in a container on the porch or patio, facing south or west, to protect it from frost. light paper bush grows best in partial shade ( two to four hours of direct sunlight per day ) or lightly shaded gardens. this plant may take more sun in a cool, moist location, but needs protection during the hottest hours. more sun exposure means more blooms. soil plant the paper bush in an area protected from strong winds in rich, loamy, and well - draining soil. before planting, use a spade to ensure the ground is moist. while the paper bush thrives in most ph environments, it is best in soil rich in organic materials. paper bush plants grow well in containers or in garden beds with mixed shrubs or perennial plants. it also works as a border plant, in mass plantings, or in woodland gardens. water paper bush plants need frequent watering throughout the summer and fall or periods of extended heat. wait to water until the top few inches of soil are dry. once established, the shrub won't need much water in winter. temperature and humidity protect paper bush plants from the harsh afternoon summer heat and strong winds. these plants are reliably winter hardy in usda zones 7 through 10, down to 5°f, if grown in humus - rich, moist, and well - draining soil. fertilizer paper bushes benefit from adding organic material to the surrounding soil yearly. organic materials such as fully decomposed compost, straw, grass clippings, and shredded bark mulch help improve the ground. add a layer of mulch surrounding the paper bush, but not touching the base, to help preserve moisture and protect the roots from harsh climates. types of paper bush paper bush is available in various showy blooms, each with distinct colors and sizes.'snow cream': boasting large clusters of highly fragrant, golden - yellow flowers, this variety is supposedly more cold - hardy than regular paper bush ( down to 0°f ).'akebono'( or'red dragon') : this variety features orange - red flowers and grows slower and more compact than other species.'grandiflora': the species with the largest flowers.'ruby splash': this variety is rare and contains red flowers. pruning paper bush plants are low - maintenance when it comes to pruning. give it about 6 feet of space so it has room to grow. young shrubs don't require any pruning except to remove dead or diseased foliage. as paper bush plants mature, the shrub produces plant suckers, an unintended branch, or new growth that adds more stress to the plant. prune plant suckers away from the primary branch structure. keeping paper bush plants healthy as they are established

SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE DEVELOPMENT:
Leaf and stem blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in the Northeast. It is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandrae. Patches of wilting and dying plants often indicate the presence of Volutella blight in a bed of pachysandra. Both leaves and stems are attacked by this fungus. Leaves develop irregular tan to brown blotches, often with concentric lighter and darker zones with dark-brown margins. These blotches gradually increase in size until the entire leaf turns brown or black and dies.
Stem cankers often develop and cause whole plants to die back. These appear as a browning of the stem at the terminal, midstem, or at ground level. Cankers first appear greenish-brown and water-soaked, but eventually turn brown or black and shrivel. As these cankers girdle the stem, they cause the whole plant to wither and die. During wet, humid weather in late spring and summer, affected plant parts can be covered with reddish-orange, cushion-like fruiting structures of the fungus. Spread of the disease within the planting is by means of these fungal spores. Plants often die in patches and the disease commonly produces circular patterns in the bed. Volutella blight is more severe in plantings weakened by winter injury, insect infestation, recent transplanting or shearing, drought, and exposure to full sun.
Control can be accomplished by following a multifaceted approach that includes sanitary, cultural, and chemical controls. All plant debris and severely disease plants should be removed and destroyed.

SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE DEVELOPMENT:

Leaf and stem blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in the

Northeast. It is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandrae. Patches of

wilting and dying plants often indicate the presence of Volutella blight in a

bed of pachysandra. Both leaves and stems are attacked by this fungus. Leaves

develop irregular tan to brown blotches, often with concentric lighter and

darker zones with dark-brown margins. These blotches gradually increase in size

until the entire leaf turns brown or black and dies.

Stem cankers often develop and cause whole plants to die back. These appear as a

browning of the stem at the terminal, midstem, or at ground level. Cankers first

appear greenish-brown and water-soaked, but eventually turn brown or black and

shrivel. As these cankers girdle the stem, they cause the whole plant to wither

and die. During wet, humid weather in late spring and summer, affected plant

parts can be covered with reddish-orange, cushion-like fruiting structures of

the fungus. Spread of the disease within the planting is by means of these

fungal spores. Plants often die in patches and the disease commonly produces

circular patterns in the bed. Volutella blight is more severe in plantings

weakened by winter injury, insect infestation, recent transplanting or shearing, 

drought, and exposure to full sun.

Control can be accomplished by following a multifaceted approach that

includes sanitary, cultural, and chemical controls. All plant debris and

severely disease plants should be removed and destroyed. The planting should be

thinned periodically to prevent dense growth and increase light and air

circulation. Among the fungicides registered for use are thiophanate methyl and chlorothalonil. Plants should be sprayed when new growth starts in

the spring and repeated according to label directions to protect newly emerging

tissues. Additional applications may be necessary during wet weather. The

pesticide label will contain information on dosage rates and safety precautions.

Since Volutella blight is associated with plant stress, attempts should be made

to control insect infestations and to maintain good growth and vigor by watering

during periods of drought and fertilizing in the spring. Since water favors

disease development, watering is best done early in the day so that drying

occurs. Thick, heavy mulches should be avoided since they hold moisture. It is

also important to remove any leaf or plant debris from the bed before growth

resumes in early spring.

Volutella blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in Connecticut and the Northeast. This disease is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandricola. Symptoms can vary from irregular, tan to brown blotches with concentric-ring patterns on the leaves to stem cankers that result in extensive wilting and death of large patches of plants within a planting bed. In addition to descriptions of these symptoms, this fact sheet includes a discussion on strategies to minimize the impact of this common disease.

User > What happened to my Monarch butterfly chrysalis? I have been raising Monarch caterpillars (to Monarch butterflies) for several years. This year, I found 3 caterpillars on the same milkweed plant late in the season - second week in September. Two were fully grown, and one was small (about 2 cm). Within 3 days, there were 2 chrysalis in the enclosure. After a few days, the 2 chrysalis slowly turned a dark coffee-like color. I had the enclosure outdoors when the storm came through in late September and I found one of these chrysalis with a hole in the bottom though nothing seemed to have escaped or been released, (or oozed) out of it. The second chrysalis still hangs in the enclosure and hasn't changed. Meanwhile the smaller caterpillar has grown, transformed normally and flew away at the end of September. Does anyone have a clue as to what happened to the first two caterpillars? Was this a fungal problem?

Title: Candy™ Coralberry | Plant Addicts
if having a bright pink winter interest shrub sounds appealing, read on about the candy coralberry. while its foliage and unique arching limbs offer a pleasant texture during the spring and summer, winter is the time for this shrub to shine. after dropping its leaves, beautiful berries adorn the limbs until late winter. standing at only about 2 ’ - 2. 5 ’ and 2. 5 ’ - 3 ’ wide, this shrub is an excellent addition to border plantings that need that extra “ pop ” during the winter season. for even more decor ideas, clip off a stem or two and place them within floral arrangements. use this darling shrub in mass planting, border planting or within hedges. while its berries seem to be the main focal point, the candy coralberry is widely beneficial to pollinators by providing a late - season source of food from its bright pink flowers! both cold hardy and heat tolerant, this shrub is quite low maintenance. candy coralberry plant care the candy coralberry does best in full sun for flower and berry production, however it will tolerate partial shade. this shrub does not like wet roots consistently, so either plant where water can easily run off or use well - draining soil. alternatively, you may plant it about 4 ” - 6 ” above the surface of the ground and mound up with dirt. choose its new home by determining where you ’ re wanting that extra “ pop ” of color and dig a hole at least two times the size of its root base. as stated above, well - draining soil is a must. the specific soil ph requirements are minimal and are considered neutral. avoid heavily acidic or heavily alkaline ph soil and your shrub will be thriving. clay, loam and sand all provide the necessary base within the soil for the candy coralberry. with consistent rainfall, your candy coralberry will thrive. supplement watering when extremely hot temperatures have been around for 5 - 7 days with no rainfall. water thoroughly without submerging the roots for an extended time. fertilizing is a breeze as the candy coralberry only needs one application per year and this can be done in late winter or early spring before the leaves bud out. use a balanced fertilizer in either granular, spray, or stick form. 20 - 20 - 20, 20 - 30 - 20, and 18 - 24 - 16 fertilizers will provide the needed nutrients for the candy coralberry to prosper in its new season. each year in early spring, it is best to do a light pruning to both shape your candy coralberry to your liking and to allow new growth. the flowers and berries emerge from new growth, so pruning is essential for the best results. only remove 1 - 5 branches per year to avoid over - pruning. cut at the base of the plant about 1 ” - 2 ” above the root base. candy coralberry plant spacing while it is compact, the candy coralberry is narrow at the bottom and has arching branches at the top. plant at least 3. 5 feet apart, center on center, and from surrounding shrubs. this spacing is the best practice for mass planting, border planting, and hedges. candy™ coralberry information simple plant spacing calculator please note : the pictures below are to give a general representation of the different container sizes. the actual size / ages of plants are estimates and will vary based on type of plant, time of year, last pruning & many other factors. we stand behind our plants with industry - leading guarantees to give you peace of mind. we want your plants to arrive in great condition! if you notice any issues upon delivery, contact us within 3 days. starting january 1, 2026 all bushes, perennials & trees purchased come with an extended 1 - year warranty for added confidence. if your plant dies due to a health issue within a year, we ’ ll make it right. pre - ordered plants are scheduled to ship in spring 2026. we carefully plan our shipping dates based on your usda plant hardiness zone to ensure optimal planting conditions upon arrival. want it sooner / later? reach out, and we'll try our best to accommodate. estimated ship week for pre - ordered plants will ship based on growing zones as shown below. note : these are only estimated ship dates. plants may ship out later depending on weather & growing conditions of the plant. note : only plants indicated as pre - order will ship as shown above. all other plants and hard goods will ship as normal. plants that are currently in stock typically ship within 2 - 7 business days after your order is placed. plant addicts ships to the lower 48 states within the u. s. unfortunately, we do not currently ship to alaska, hawaii, or internationally. this plant cannot be shipped to the following states : ak, hi. these restrictions apply only to this specific plant due to agricultural regulations or other limitations. other plants may still be available for shipping to these states. if you have any questions about shipping restrictions, feel free to reach out to our team!"

User > Tomato Disease ID help needed: I am wondering if you could help me identify what is going on with my heirloom tomato starts? They are under good quality grow lights in our house. Their germination seemed normal, and everything seemed to be going well, until it wasn't. The symptoms started with the 'Vernazza' variety cotyledons turning purple. Next the purple color spread to the first true leaves right above the cotyledons and little bumps appeared on the underside of the purple leaves. As the leaves were getting ready to fall off, they formed a noticeable thick white-ish band around the stems, it almost looked calcified, but wasn't hard in texture. The leaves started to curl and at this point we realized it was all of the 'Vernazza' variety. It then started spreading to the other tomato varieties, so we isolated all the tomatoes away from the other solanaceous crops. I looked at the roots, and I don't see anything unusual, I also don't see any pests. I plan on reseeding but I am tempted to not seed any 'Vernazza' with fear that the seed is what is infected? I reached out to the seed company to also see if they had heard or seen this happen.

EVIDENCE:
leaves. if you ’ re growing your begonias outdoors and you notice curling leaves, look at other nearby plants of different species. do they have curled leaves, too? or perhaps their foliage is wilting and yellowing? if so, it ’ s highly probable that they ’ ve suffered herbicide injury. even if you didn ’ t apply herbicides in your own garden, it ’ s possible that some wafted over from a neighbor or maybe your local government applied herbicides to public areas nearby. or perhaps you recently treated your lawn? you might wonder if what you are seeing is a result of a pest or disease issue. typically, specific pests or diseases stick to plants in the same genus or family. powdery mildew in legumes, for example, is caused by microsphaera diffusa while in begonias it ’ s caused by oidium begoniae. but if totally unrelated species are symptomatic, the cause is usually something else like a watering issue or herbicide damage. so, if your begonias and nearby hostas are both showing symptoms of leaf curl, it ’ s probably not a pest or disease issue since the plants are from different genera. if you suspect herbicides are the problem, there ’ s not much to do except find where they came from and stop it from happening again. 3. mealybugs or scale sapsuckers like mealybugs and scale cause stress to the begonia, and this stress can result in curling leaves. both scale and mealybugs are fairly easy to identify once you know what to look for. both are oval and flat, and either brown, tan, black, or white with a waxy coating. they like to hang out on the stems and at the leaf joints, so look closely in those areas. these pests don ’ t move much, and they tend to cluster together, so people sometimes mistake them for symptoms of a disease. but try scraping them off and squishing them – if they come off easily or they can be smashed, they are bugs, not symptoms of a disease. i know, gross. if scale or mealybugs are the cause of the leaf curl, you can simply scrape them off the plant using a butter knife or dab them with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. broad, tropical, or begonia mites ( polyphagotarsonemus latus ) are an invisible monster. they ’ re about 0. 02 millimeters in length, so you won ’ t be able to see them with the naked eye. these pests thrive in the same conditions as begonias, namely warm and humid. you ’ ll find them all over in greenhouses and tropical areas and they feed on many warm - weather species. when the mites feed on the plant, they cause the terminal leaves to curl and roll. they can also cause deformed buds and stunted growth. you can get out a magnifying glass and examine the begonias closely to try and see the mites. they like to hide in areas that are shaded and hidden. if you see them or even suspect an infestation, treat the plant with insecticidal soap. spray once a week with the soap on a day when there is no rain expected if your plants are outside. insecticidal soap is handy to have around since it tackles many insect problems"

Leaf and stem blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in the
Northeast. It is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandrae. Patches of
wilting and dying plants often indicate the presence of Volutella blight in a
bed of pachysandra. Both leaves and stems are attacked by this fungus. Leaves
develop irregular tan to brown blotches, often with concentric lighter and
darker zones with dark-brown margins. These blotches gradually increase in size
until the entire leaf turns brown or black and dies.
Stem cankers often develop and cause whole plants to die back. These appear as a

circular patterns in the bed. Volutella blight is more severe in plantings
weakened by winter injury, insect infestation, recent transplanting or shearing,
drought, and exposure to full sun.
Control can be accomplished by following a multifaceted approach that
includes sanitary, cultural, and chemical controls. All plant debris and
severely disease plants should be removed and destroyed. The planting should be
thinned periodically to prevent dense growth and increase light and air
circulation. Among the fungicides registered for use are thiophanate methyl and
chlorothalonil. Plants should be sprayed when new growth starts in the spring and
repeated according to label directions to protect newly emerging tissues.
Additional applications may be necessary during wet weather. The pesticide label
will contain information on dosage rates and safety precautions.
Since Volutella blight is associated with plant stress, attempts should be made
to control insect infestations and to maintain good growth and vigor by watering
during periods of drought and fertilizing in the spring. Since water favors
disease development, watering is best done early in the day so that drying
occurs. Thick, heavy mulches should be avoided since they hold moisture. It is
also important to remove any leaf or plant debris from the bed before growth
resumes in early spring.
Volutella blight is the most destructive disease of pachysandra in Connecticut and the Northeast. This disease is caused by the fungus Volutella pachysandrae. Symptoms can vary from irregular, tan to brown blotches with concentric-ring patterns on the leaves to stem cankers that result in extensive wilting and death of large patches of plants within a planting bed. In addition to descriptions of these symptoms, this fact sheet includes a discussion on strategies to minimize the impact of this common disease. "

Title: 6 Plants & Flowers to Attract Honey Bees | Manukora
best. these flowers can tolerate dirt, gravel, or any poor soil. they stand tall so the honeybees can see their white glow from afar. there ’ s no need to water these plants daily, as they prefer their soil to be only slightly moist and mostly dry. they ’ re spring flowers and will attract more than just bees to your garden — butterflies love them, too! 4. purple coneflower ( echinacea purpurea ) humans aren ’ t the only ones who love the vibrant purple shade of these coneflowers ; honeybees, hummingbirds, and butterflies will become frequent visitors to your garden after they bloom. as long they have plenty of room to flourish, these flowers can grow up to five feet tall. they require full sun and heaps of water, but their upkeep is well worth the return. 5. joe - pye weed ( eutrochium purpureum ) spring and summer gardens are great for your honeybees, but fall flowers matter too. joe - pye weed thrives in the cooler months, and its highly aromatic scents will attract all types of pollinators ( hummingbirds included ). 6. wrinkleleaf goldenrod ( solidago rugosa ) another flower that thrives in the fall months is the wrinkleleaf goldenrod. their vibrant yellow colors won ’ t wilt away from a little cool weather or rough soil. they ’ re durable and can thrive in many environments — another great option if you don ’ t have the greenest thumb on your block. planting bee - friendly flowers, such as bee balm, coral honeysuckle, white wild indigo, purple coneflower, joe - pye weed, and wrinkleleaf goldenrod, can help support honeybees and other pollinators. these plants provide nectar and pollen, attracting bees to your garden and helping to sustain their populations. how do i garden for bees? if the purpose of your garden is to attract plenty of bees to your yard, then there are a few rules you should follow for optimal results. do : plant in large patches. planting your flowers too far apart will double the bees ’ foraging time. so, always plant in large clusters, only three to five feet apart, giving them plenty of blossoms to work with. do : plant a wide variety of plant species. as long the species you plant are native to your region and will thrive in your environment, plant a wide variety of plants — the more, the merrier. most bee species like to have variety wherever they decide to feast, so having plenty of plants to choose from is key. that said, western honeybees ( apis mellifera ) harvest primarily from the manuka tea tree because of it ’ s availability and flowering season. at manukora, our honeybees have access to an abundant forest of manuka tea trees to feast on. while they may wander to other plants, we test all of our honey to ensure that it is monofloral ( only from the local manuka flowers ). in fact, you can check any manukora honey product for a unique qr code. by scanning this code, you can learn about the hive your honey came from, the beekeeper responsible for the bees ’ care, and the exact potency results for each batch. these results include mgo, leptosperin, and other markers used by the ministry for primary industries ( mpi ) to indicate authenticity. don ’ t : use pesticides. when planting a garden, pests are inevitable and a part of nature. while treating your plants with pesticides or sprays can be tempting, it can harm your garden, the bees, and your environment in the long run. at manukora, we ’ re highly aware of the damage pesticides can cause, which is why we test every batch of our honey to ensure it is free from pesticides. do : create a bee - friendly environment. you want to create the most bee - friendly environment to attract the most bees to your garden. bees need more than just vibrant, tasty flowers to inhabit your yard — protection from the elements, water, and nesting sites are essential pieces of the puzzle. here are a few things to add to your yard to get those honeybees buzzing back. bees aren ’ t picky ; natural water sources usually suffice, but it ’ s not a bad idea to install a water source with a perch so they can drink comfortably. a small birdbath with large rocks and stones is an easy option that also usually works visually well in any garden. when away from the hive, bees need shelter. whether from the rain or sun, you want to have a place where the bees can hide if necessary. you can put a container on its side for your bee break room or compile a few bushels of twigs and sticks where the bees can take a breather. the beehives don ’ t need to be fancy, just a place for them to rest or stay out of sight when needed. at the end of the workday, honeybees return to their hives, but native bees are different and are usually solitary, meaning they don ’ t have hives. providing nesting sites is only necessary if you ’ re working with native bees. native bees often nest in cavities like dead wood and hollow stems, or even burrow into the ground, depending on the species. to create a thriving bee - friendly garden, plant flowers in large clusters, only three to five feet apart, to minimize the bees'foraging time. offer a wide variety of native plant species to provide a diverse feast for the bees. avoid using pesticides, as they can harm the bees and the environment. additionally, create a bee - friendly environment by providing a water source, shelter, and nesting sites for native bees. growing local plants is beneficial to the bees, and their honey production is a great way to help maintain ( or increase ) the plummeting bee population. attracting honeybees rather than native bees requires different plants and flowers ; the same goes for our honeybees. in the range of manuka honey available, such as the mgo850 +, which showcases this special honey's distinct flavor and benefits. enhance your honey experience with tools like the manukora dose spoon, designed to complement your honey consumption perfectly. dive deeper into the world of honey with informative guides about honey energy, the feasibility of eating honeycomb, and the soothing effects of manuka honey on a sore throat. finally, the guide on what to eat with honey offers creative and delicious ideas for those curious about pairing honey with various foods. as authentic manuka honey gains traction, you may wonder how you can get your hands on this honey yourself. unfortunately, no amount of honeybees you bring to your garden can make manuka honey unless you live in new zealand. while the european bees that make our manuka honey might occasionally indulge in other nectars, they are committed to the leptospermum scoparium tree ( i. e., the new zealand manuka tea tree ). the blossoms responsible for our uniquely tasting and textured honey are native to new zealand and grow nowhere else in the world. new zealand has a unique environment, which is why these tea tree plants aren ’ t found anywhere else, and why manuka honey is only made in new zealand forests. ready to explore more manuka for yourself? check out our blog here for more articles on manuka and all things bees, or browse through our authentic, high - quality manuka honey here. why is it important to choose specific plants for honeybees in my garden? choosing specific plants for honeybees is crucial because bees require a healthy and balanced diet to thrive. planting a variety of bee - attractive flowers provides necessary nectar and pollen that support their health and their crucial role in pollination, which is essential for maintaining biodiversity and food production. what are the best plants to attract honeybees to my garden? some of the best plants to attract honeybees include bee balm ( monarda spp. ), which is particularly loved by honeybees for its nectar ; coral honeysuckle, known for its attractive tubular flowers ; and purple coneflower ( echinacea purpurea ), which is not only appealing due to its vibrant color but also its rich nectar content. these plants not only support bees'nutritional needs but also enhance your garden's ecological health. how does the choice of plants affect honey production from bees? the type of plants available to bees can significantly influence the quality and quantity of honey they produce. plants like the manuka bush in new zealand are particularly crucial for producing manuka honey with its unique properties. in general, the richer the diversity of nectar sources, the healthier the bee population and the more robust their honey production. what should i consider when planning a bee garden? when planning a bee garden, consider factors like the local bee population types, plant varieties that thrive in your geographical area, and the flowering period of the plants to ensure continuous bloom throughout the season. avoiding pesticides, providing a water source, and creating shelters to support a healthy bee environment is vital. can planting certain flowers improve the health of bees? yes, planting certain flowers can significantly improve the health of bees. flowers that produce ample nectar and pollen, such as joe - pye weed and wrinkleleaf goldenrod, provide food and aid in maintaining the bees'immune system.

User: What's this reddish-brown, wiry like substance in my compost? I'm relatively new to Oregon. This is the second year I've lived in Eugene and have been composting and gardening. I've come across this substance in my compost pile a couple of times and don't know what it is. It's woven like netting through and between the decomposing leaves in the compost. I'm not sure if it is a remnant of the leaves themselves or some kind of invasive root. It's very pervasive in the bottom of the pile. Do you know what it is? Is it desirable? Undesirable?

Title: Money Tree Fungal Infection (And How To Treat It) – Cafe Planta
money trees, or pachira aquatica, are popular houseplants known for their braided trunks and lush green leaves. they're often associated with good fortune and prosperity. however, like any plant, they can fall victim to pests and diseases. one of the common concerns for money tree owners is fungal infections, which can be quite a challenge if not addressed promptly. in this article, we'll guide you through the signs of fungal infections in money trees, discuss their causes, and provide practical steps to treat and prevent these issues. we'll also share some tips on maintaining a healthy environment for your plant, so you can enjoy its beauty and benefits for years to come. identifying fungal infections in money trees so, how can you tell if your money tree is suffering from a fungal infection? recognizing the symptoms early is crucial for effective treatment. here are some common signs to watch for : - leaf spots : these are often the first indication. they appear as dark, water - soaked patches on the leaves, which can eventually turn yellow or brown. - powdery mildew : this appears as a white, powdery substance on the leaves and stems, almost like someone dusted your plant with flour. - leaf curling or dropping : while not exclusive to fungal infections, if accompanied by spots or mildew, it could be a red flag. - root rot : this occurs when the roots become mushy and discolored, often due to overwatering, creating a breeding ground for fungi. if you're seeing any of these signs, it's time to take a closer look at what might be causing the problem. but don't worry ; we'll walk you through how to tackle these issues. understanding the causes of fungal infections now that you know what to look for, let's talk about why these fungal infections occur in the first place. understanding the causes can help you prevent future issues and keep your money tree healthy. fungal infections often arise from a combination of factors, including : - overwatering : this is the most common culprit. when a plant sits in waterlogged soil, it creates an ideal environment for fungi to thrive. - poor air circulation : stagnant air can cause moisture to linger on leaves and stems, encouraging fungal growth. - humidity : while money trees generally love humidity, too much can lead to fungal problems if the air is not well - circulated. - contaminated tools or soil : fungi can be introduced through dirty gardening tools or infected soil, spreading quickly if not addressed. these factors often work in combination, so it's important to consider all of them when diagnosing and treating a fungal infection. next, we'll dive into how to effectively treat these infections. treating fungal infections : step - by - step guide got a fungal infection on your hands? don't panic! treating your money tree is doable, and with a little patience, your plant will be back to its healthy self. here's how to tackle the issue : 1. isolate the plant first things first : separate the infected plant from others. fungal infections can spread, and you don't want your entire indoor garden catching what your money tree has. 2. trim infected areas using clean, sterilized scissors or pruning shears, remove the affected leaves and stems. this prevents the infection from spreading further. be sure to dispose of these cuttings properly — far away from your other plants. consider using an appropriate fungicide, available at most garden centers. organic options, such as neem oil, can be effective and are safer for the environment. follow the instructions carefully, and consider doing a patch test on a small part of the plant first. 4. adjust watering practices review how often you're watering your money tree. ensure the soil has time to dry out between waterings. a good rule of thumb is to water when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. 5. improve air circulation place your money tree in a well - ventilated area to help reduce humidity levels and promote air circulation. if necessary, use a fan to keep the air moving, but avoid blowing directly onto the plant. with these steps, your money tree should start showing signs of improvement. just remember, healing takes time, so be patient with your leafy friend. preventing fungal infections in the future once your money tree has bounced back, you'll want to make sure it stays healthy. prevention is always better than cure, and here are some tips to keep those pesky fungi at bay : 1. proper watering techniques we've already mentioned how overwatering can lead to fungal infections, so finding the right balance is crucial. use a pot with drainage holes and consider a well - draining soil mix to prevent water from pooling. ensure your plant has enough space around it for air to circulate. this is especially important if you've got a collection of plants that might be crowding each other. after using gardening tools, clean them thoroughly with a mixture of water and bleach or alcohol. this helps prevent the transfer of fungi from one plant to another. 4. monitor humidity levels while money trees love some humidity, too much can encourage fungal growth. use a humidity meter to keep an eye on levels, and adjust with a humidifier or dehumidifier as needed. staying proactive about these factors will go a long way in preventing future fungal infections and keeping your money tree lush and healthy. choosing the right soil and pot for your money tree a crucial aspect of preventing fungal infections is ensuring your money tree has the right soil and pot. here ’ s how you can make the best choice : 1. opt for well - draining soil use a potting mix that drains well. you can find specific mixes designed for indoor tropical plants, or make your own by mixing regular potting soil with sand or perlite. 2. choose the right pot pick a pot with at least one drainage hole. this helps excess water escape, keeping the roots dry and healthy. terracotta pots are a great option as they allow moisture to evaporate through the walls, reducing the risk of waterlogging. 3. repot when necessary if your money tree outgrows its pot or the soil becomes compacted, it might be time for a change. repotting can refresh the soil and give the roots more room to breathe, reducing the chances of fungal infections. providing the right environment with suitable soil and pots can make a significant difference in your plant's overall health and resilience. environmental factors and their impact on plant health beyond soil and watering, the environment where you place your money tree plays a crucial role in its health. here are some factors to consider : money trees prefer bright, indirect light. too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, while too little can make them leggy and weak. find a spot that offers balanced light, like near an east - facing window. these plants thrive in temperatures between 65°f and 80°f ( 18°c to 27°c ). avoid placing them in drafty areas or near heaters, as sudden temperature changes can stress the plant. during winter, your plant's growth may slow down, requiring less water. be mindful of these seasonal shifts and adjust your care routine accordingly. creating a stable environment that mimics their natural habitat helps money trees flourish, reducing the risk of stress - related issues like fungal infections. common missteps in money tree care even with the best intentions, it's easy to make mistakes while caring for a money tree. here are some common missteps and how to avoid them : we can't stress this enough — too much water is a big no - no. stick to a consistent watering schedule and always check soil moisture before adding more. fungal infections can sometimes follow pest infestations. keep an eye out for common pests like spider mites or aphids, and treat them promptly to prevent further complications. 3. neglecting routine checks regular inspections of your plant can help catch problems early. take time to check the leaves, soil, and overall health of your money tree every couple of weeks. by steering clear of these pitfalls, you can ensure your plant stays healthy and reduces the likelihood of encountering fungal issues. diy remedies for fungal infections if you're looking for natural alternatives to store - bought fungicides, there are several diy remedies you can try. here are a few options : 1. baking soda solution mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with a quart of water. add a few drops of dish soap to help the solution stick to the leaves, then spray onto affected areas. this can help disrupt the growth of fungi. believe it or not, milk can act as a natural fungicide. mix equal parts milk and water and spray on the infected areas. the proteins in milk can help combat fungal spores. combine 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with a gallon of water. spray this solution on the affected leaves to help control mild fungal infections. these remedies can be effective for mild cases and are a great option for those who prefer a natural approach to plant care. caring for your money tree after treatment once your money tree has recovered from a fungal infection, it's essential to maintain a consistent care routine to keep it healthy and thriving. here's what you can do : 1. continue monitoring regularly check your plant for any signs of returning issues. early detection is vital to prevent a recurrence of fungal infections. 2. keep up with proper watering stick to your improved watering practices. remember, letting the top inch of soil dry out before watering again is a good rule of thumb. 3. maintain the environment ensure your plant's environment remains stable, with adequate light and airflow. these factors are key to keeping your money tree healthy post -

User > I am experiencing trouble with my bonsai tree in terms of watering. I've been having issues with my bonsai tree in terms of watering. I started out watering the bonsai daily with a spray bottle, but it seemed to be drying out. Then, I placed the bonsai pot in a larger bowl of water so the bonsai could take in water at its own pace. However, this method caused the soil around the bonsai to become moldy. I let the pot dry out, removed the mold, and am now back to spraying the plant with water daily. Once again, this method isn't working well. The leaves are losing their color and turning yellow. Do you have any suggestions for how to water a bonsai appropriately?

Title: What Causes Begonia Leaves to Curl? (and What to Do About It)
leaves. if you ’ re growing your begonias outdoors and you notice curling leaves, look at other nearby plants of different species. do they have curled leaves, too? or perhaps their foliage is wilting and yellowing? if so, it ’ s highly probable that they ’ ve suffered herbicide injury. even if you didn ’ t apply herbicides in your own garden, it ’ s possible that some wafted over from a neighbor or maybe your local government applied herbicides to public areas nearby. or perhaps you recently treated your lawn? you might wonder if what you are seeing is a result of a pest or disease issue. typically, specific pests or diseases stick to plants in the same genus or family. powdery mildew in legumes, for example, is caused by microsphaera diffusa while in begonias it ’ s caused by oidium begoniae. but if totally unrelated species are symptomatic, the cause is usually something else like a watering issue or herbicide damage. so, if your begonias and nearby hostas are both showing symptoms of leaf curl, it ’ s probably not a pest or disease issue since the plants are from different genera. if you suspect herbicides are the problem, there ’ s not much to do except find where they came from and stop it from happening again. 3. mealybugs or scale sapsuckers like mealybugs and scale cause stress to the begonia, and this stress can result in curling leaves. both scale and mealybugs are fairly easy to identify once you know what to look for. both are oval and flat, and either brown, tan, black, or white with a waxy coating. they like to hang out on the stems and at the leaf joints, so look closely in those areas. these pests don ’ t move much, and they tend to cluster together, so people sometimes mistake them for symptoms of a disease. but try scraping them off and squishing them – if they come off easily or they can be smashed, they are bugs, not symptoms of a disease. i know, gross. if scale or mealybugs are the cause of the leaf curl, you can simply scrape them off the plant using a butter knife or dab them with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. broad, tropical, or begonia mites ( polyphagotarsonemus latus ) are an invisible monster. they ’ re about 0. 02 millimeters in length, so you won ’ t be able to see them with the naked eye. these pests thrive in the same conditions as begonias, namely warm and humid. you ’ ll find them all over in greenhouses and tropical areas and they feed on many warm - weather species. when the mites feed on the plant, they cause the terminal leaves to curl and roll. they can also cause deformed buds and stunted growth. you can get out a magnifying glass and examine the begonias closely to try and see the mites. they like to hide in areas that are shaded and hidden. if you see them or even suspect an infestation, treat the plant with insecticidal soap. spray once a week with the soap on a day when there is no rain expected if your plants are outside. insecticidal soap is handy to have around since it tackles many insect problems"

User > I am considering planting horsetail reeds in a 10 ft long cement planter box in front of my modern style house. A member of my neighborhood advised against it, citing their experience that horsetail reeds are highly invasive, high maintenance, and can spread rampantly due to their prolific seed pods. I'm concerned about this as it could affect others in my neighborhood. Conversely, an acquaintance mentioned, “Yes, it can multiply, but I haven’t found it invasive; that’s a strong word in my opinion. Perfect if you want it to multiply. I've had it in my garden for three years, and it occasionally pops up in my yard, but they are easy to pull up and don’t return in that spot. A planter would be great and look good. They've never appeared in any other nearby garden beds." Given this conflicting information, I am in a quandary and would like your expert advice, please.

Title: Watering Bonsai; how to water your trees - Bonsai Empire
The most important part of taking care of your Bonsai trees is watering. How often a tree needs to be watered depends on several factors such as; species of the tree, size of the tree, size of the pot, time of year, soil-mixture, and climate.
To summarize, make sure your Bonsai tree never dries out completely. Wait for the soil to become slightly dry and then water it. When you water your Bonsai, make sure to do so very thoroughly, to make sure the entire root mass is reached.

Title: Image analysis - Wikipedia
image analysis or imagery analysis is the extraction of meaningful information from images ; mainly from digital images by means of digital image processing techniques. [ 1 ] image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading bar coded tags or as sophisticated as identifying a person from their face. computers are indispensable for the analysis of large amounts of data, for tasks that require complex computation, or for the extraction of quantitative information. on the other hand, the human visual cortex is an excellent image analysis apparatus, especially for extracting higher - level information, and for many applications — including medicine, security, and remote sensing — human analysts still cannot be replaced by computers. for this reason, many important image analysis tools such as edge detectors and neural networks are inspired by human visual perception models. [ edit ] digital image analysis or computer image analysis is when a computer or electrical device automatically studies an image to obtain useful information from it. note that the device is often a computer but may also be an electrical circuit, a digital camera or a mobile phone. it involves the fields of computer or machine vision, and medical imaging, and makes heavy use of pattern recognition, digital geometry, and signal processing. this field of computer science developed in the 1950s at academic institutions such as the mit a. i. lab, originally as a branch of artificial intelligence and robotics. it is the quantitative or qualitative characterization of two - dimensional ( 2d ) or three - dimensional ( 3d ) digital images. 2d images are, for example, to be analyzed in computer vision, and 3d images in medical imaging. the field was established in the 1950s — 1970s, for example with pioneering contributions by azriel rosenfeld, herbert freeman, jack e. bresenham, or king - sun fu. [ edit ] there are many different techniques used in automatically analysing images. each technique may be useful for a small range of tasks, however there still aren't any known methods of image analysis that are generic enough for wide ranges of tasks, compared to the abilities of a human's image analysing capabilities. examples of image analysis techniques in different fields include : - 2d and 3d object recognition, - image segmentation, - motion detection e. g. single particle tracking, - medical scan analysis, - 3d pose estimation. [ edit ] the applications of digital image analysis are continuously expanding through all areas of science and industry, including : - anatomy, allows for precise measurements, visualization, and statistical analysis of anatomical structures. [ 2 ] - assay micro plate reading, such as detecting where a chemical was manufactured. - astronomy, such as calculating the size of a planet. - automated species identification ( e. g. plant and animal species ) - error level analysis - machine vision, such as to automatically count items in a factory conveyor belt. - materials science, such as determining if a metal weld has cracks. - medicine, such as detecting cancer in a mammography scan. - metallography, such as determining the mineral content of a rock sample. - microscopy, such as counting the germs in a swab. - automatic number plate recognition ; - optical character recognition, such as automatic license plate detection. - remote sensing, such as detecting intruders in a house, and producing land cover / land use maps. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] - robotics, such as to avoid steering into an obstacle. - security, such as detecting a person's eye color or hair color. [ edit ] object - based image analysis ( obia ) involves two typical processes, segmentation and classification. segmentation helps to group pixels into homogeneous objects. the objects typically correspond to individual features of interest, although over - segmentation or under - segmentation is very likely. classification then can be performed at object levels, using various statistics of the objects as features in the classifier. statistics can include geometry, context and texture of image objects. over - segmentation is often preferred over under - segmentation when classifying high - resolution images. [ 5 ] object - based image analysis has been applied in many fields, such as cell biology, medicine, earth sciences, and remote sensing. for example, it can detect changes of cellular shapes in the process of cell differentiation. ; [ 6 ] it has also been widely used in the mapping community to generate land cover. [ 5 ] [ 7 ] when applied to earth images, obia is known as geographic object - based image analysis ( geobia ), defined as \\\" a sub - discipline of geoinformation science devoted to (... ) partitioning remote sensing ( rs ) imagery into meaningful image - objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale \\\". [ 8 ] [ 7 ] the international geobia conference has been held biannually since 2006. [ 9 ] obia techniques are implemented in software such as ecognition or the orfeo toolbox.

Title: Why are all these bugs appearing on the side or inside of my home? - Gardening in Michigan
\n\nwhy are all these bugs appearing on the side or inside of my home? nuisance insects that aggregate on homes and structures in the fall. as the shadows lengthen and days get shorter, we start to see some six - legged friends sneaking around our windows, eaves and soffits. this is a good time for a reminder about just who some of these insects are and how you can tell them apart. the fall invaders are all just following their natural inclination to seek an out - of - the - way resting place to spend the winter. unfortunately for all parties involved, what happens next is anything but natural. the exterior side walls of our structures provide a very attractive array of nooks and crannies for these critters to sneak into. the problem is that these nooks and crannies often lead into the interiors of our human dwellings. who are the insects on the side of my home? three of these fall invading species in michigan are all closely related insects in the order hemiptera ( true bugs ). they are the boxelder bug, brown marmorated stink bug and western conifer seed bug ( table 1 ). it is possible to find all three on the outside of structures in late summer or fall. of these three insects, brown marmorated stink bug is the newest arrival to michigan and the only one that is a garden or agricultural pest, according to michigan state university extension. often confused for a stink bug, western conifer seed bug is less common than brown marmorated stink bug and typically remains unnoticed until fall. boxelder bugs are not garden pests, but they can be a nuisance in homes simply due to the sheer number of them that can accumulate on windowsills and in attics during winter. in case you are unsure whether the insects in your home are brown marmorated stink bugs, photo 1 and table 1 will help tell them apart. the shape of their hind legs, overall body shape and color can be used to differentiate these three fall invaders. additional information on managing brown marmorated stink bug can be found on the stop bmsb website. like many of the other insects in the order hemiptera ( true bugs ), these bugs have a piercing sucking mouthpart and are capable of using it in self - defense. in other words, handle them with caution. none of these insects transmit any disease or sting. they also will not reproduce in the winter. their presence is restricted to being a nuisance. in severe cases, high numbers of these bugs may stain furniture through external secretions. a fourth fall invading insect worth mentioning is the multi - colored asian lady beetle ( photo 2 ). these beetles spend their summers eating aphids and other pest insects in our crop fields. in the fall, they can form large aggregations on the sides of structures as they look for a place to spend the winter. unlike the three insects mentioned previously, multi - colored asian lady beetles are beetles ( coleoptera ), not true bugs. asian lady beetles can bite but cannot spread disease. they also emit defensive secretions that have a slight odor, can stain fabrics and in rare cases have been known to cause allergic reactions. what causes these insects to aggregate? the summer months are a time when insects are active in gardens, trees or shrubs. as daylight lessens, insects undergo a physiological change known as diapause. this is characterized by an extended time of inactivity during which they do not reproduce and eat little or nothing. in their natural habitat, these insects spend winter beneath bark. stink bugs begin to aggregate on the sides of buildings and structures when there is less than 12. 5 hours of daylight, approximately the second or third week of september in michigan. south and west facing walls are most susceptible to large populations. they particularly move towards garages, sheds and sidings with small spaces or gaps that are protected from the weather. for several weeks in the fall, stink bugs and other aggregating insects may attempt to enter homes in search of a winter environment protected from moisture and cooler air temperatures. how can i keep them out of my home? during fall, search for spots on the outside of the house with gaps that are wide enough for insects to enter. these areas can be covered with wire mesh, screens or caulk. window air conditioning units should be checked for gaps and covered. when there are hundreds of swarming insects on the outside of a home, leave the windows closed or check for gaps in the screen. a strong force of water can knock insects off exterior walls. on homes with severe outbreaks, a pyrethroid insecticide can be applied to the foundation or siding. this will only kill insects that contact the insecticide and is not an effective long - term strategy. since these fall - invading insects can fly up to several miles, it is likely more will return on the next warm day. when smaller numbers are present inside or outside, the insects can be knocked into a bucket of soapy water, vacuumed up or just left alone. what can i do once they get inside? the best way to control indoor nuisance pests is through removal or exclusion. inside homes, stink bugs are attracted to light and may fly towards light fixtures, resulting in an annoying buzz. a homemade light trap with light shined into a foil pan containing unscented dish soap and water can provide relief at killing stink bugs already inside the home ( photo 3 ). it is not recommended to apply insecticides to overwintering insects that are already inside your home. the chemicals will only kill insects that make direct contact and will not prevent additional insects from finding their way inside. when hundreds of stink bugs are found in the home or shed, they can be vacuumed with a shop - vac. on warmer winter days, a stray stink bug or two may emerge from diapause and walk or fly around the house. by this time, all overwintered insects are already inside a home, and hand - picking is the easiest way to eliminate them.\n\nTitle: Why are all these bugs appearing on the side or inside of my home?

Title: How to identify and care for holiday cacti and get them to rebloom | Good Growing | Illinois Extension | UIUC

poinsettias, amaryllis, holly, and evergreens are common sights during the holidays. another group of plants, holiday cacti, also make an appearance this time of year. with their brightly colored flowers ranging from white, pink, yellow, orange, red, or purple, they can be a great addition to your holiday decor. unlike many of our holiday plants, they are often kept and grown as houseplants after the holidays. they can also be very long-lived. it ’ s not unheard of for plants to be 100 years old and passed down from generation to generation. while they are commonly referred to as christmas cactus, there are several different types of holiday cacti sold : the thanksgiving cactus, schlumbergera truncata ; the christmas cactus, schlumbergera x buckleyi and schlumbergera bridgesii ; and the easter / spring cactus, rhipsalidopsis gaertneri. they get their common names from the holiday closest to their traditional bloom dates. however, they may be forced to bloom at other times of the year. what holiday cacti do i have? most of the ‘ christmas cactuses ’ sold are actually thanksgiving cacti. to differentiate between the three types of holiday cacti, look at their ‘ leaves ’ ( the ‘ leaves ’ are actually flattened stem segments called phylloclades, not true leaves ). thanksgiving cacti, also known as crab cacti, have pointed teeth along the outside margins of the leaves that look like hooks or claws. christmas cacti have smooth, more rounded / scalloped margins. easter cacti have rounded margins. the flowers can also be used to differentiate the different types. both thanksgiving and christmas cacti have tubular flowers. however, the anthers of thanksgiving cacti are yellow, and christmas cacti are purplish-brown. easter cacti, on the other hand, have star-shaped flowers. timing of the blooms can sometimes be helpful, but plants can be forced to bloom outside of their ‘ normal ’ blooming period. thanksgiving cacti will typically bloom from late november to late december, which is why we often see them in the lead-up to christmas. christmas cacti typically bloom from late december to march, and easter / spring cacti typically bloom from march to may. caring for holiday cacti while holiday cacti are true cacti, they are quite different from the cacti growing in deserts. holiday cacti are native to tropical mountainous regions of southeast brazil. they do not grow in the ground but are epiphytic, growing in the crotches of trees where debris and organic matter build-up. keeping this in mind, their cultural requirements are quite different from desert-growing cacti. while plants are blooming, they should be placed in bright, indirect light with temperatures ranging from 70°f during the day to 55-65°f at night. soil should be kept moist, but make sure they aren ’ t sitting in water. if plants get too dry while blooming, plants may drop their flowers. once done flowering, they can be grown as houseplants. cut back on watering slightly until new growth begins to appear ( keep plants on the dry side ). then, resume watering like normal ( allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings )."

User > Why are the leaves of one of our Laurel bushes, which I think are Cherry laurels, turning brown? These plants are on the north side of our house and get only moderate direct sun. Drainage isn’t great but they’ve been healthy until now after living here for 23 years. Although there was a brief outbreak of scale 4-5 years back, we managed it quickly. Most of our laurels remain unaffected except for a small patch on a nearby plant. However, the rest of the laurels look healthy and robust, even blooming now (10/15/21). I’ve attached photos for a better diagnosis and would appreciate suggestions for a remedy.

EVIDENCE:
Mountain laurel is a broad-leaved evergreen shrub, native to the United States where it is much beloved. Mountain laurel usually remains green year round, so brown leaves on mountain laurels can be a sign of trouble. Determining the reason for brown mountain laurel leaves can be challenging and involves careful detective work. The following information may help.

Why Mountain Laurel Leaves are Browning

Below are the top reasons for brown leaves on mountain laurels: Desiccation/winter burn – Brown leaves on mountain laurels can be caused by desiccation, which occurs when winter wind draws moisture from the tissues. If the plant is unable to pull moisture from the soil, the water in the cells isn’t replaced and leaves turn brown. To prevent desiccation, ensure the tree is properly watered during dry periods. Cold temperatures – Damage can occur when winter temperatures are unusually cold, but it is most likely to occur in trees planted in the northern borders of their USDA hardiness range. An organic mulch will help during the winter. If necessary, protect mountain laurel trees with a burlap windbreak. Improper watering – Brown mountain laurel leaves, primarily when browning shows up at leaf tips, may be due to improper watering or excessively dry soil. Always water the tree deeply every seven to 10 during absence of rain by allowing a hose or soaker to soak the ground for at least 45 minutes. A layer of mulch will keep the soil evenly moist but be sure to leave a span of bare ground around the stem. Fertilizer burn – Strong chemical fertilizer may be the reason for mountain laurel leaves turning brown, especially if discoloration affects the tips and edges. The tree may be absorbing too much fertilizer without your realization if it’s planted close to a heavily fertilized lawn. Follow fertilizer manufacturer recommendations closely. Never fertilize dry soil or a thirsty tree. Sunburn – When mountain laurel leaves are browning, it may be because the tree is exposed to too much intense, direct sunlight. Mountain laurel shrubs prefer plenty of morning sunlight but should be in shade during the afternoon. Drought – Established mountain laurel trees are relatively drought tolerant, but they aren’t likely to tolerate long periods of extreme drought. Mulch is critical to help mountain laurel trees survive drought and summer heat. Disease – While not often an issue, mountain laurel shrubs do suffer from occasional fungal problems, especially in areas with abundant humidity and moisture. Leaf spot is the most common of these and will cause browning of the leaves. Fungicides can help.

Title: Money tree leaf problems - Ask Extension
\n\nmoney tree leaf problems # 803190 asked july 26, 2022, 5 : 10 pm edt st. clair county michigan money tree plants like a mix of direct and bright, indirect sunlight and relatively high humidity. as with most houseplants, too much direct sun can scorch the leaves. to achieve the right balance with your money tree, turn or rotate it regularly for more even light distribution. just make sure to not move it all over the place so as to not disturb it too much. money trees can handle fluorescent lighting, so you're safe to keep one in your office as long as you take adequate care of it. money tree plants do best in warmer environments, so you'll want to keep them in an area that's between 65 and 75 degrees fahrenheit. as far as humidity goes, money trees thrive with extra moisture, so it might be a good idea to mist your plant regularly or put it on a pebble tray to increase humidity in the winter. prune off any dead, damaged, or dying leaves / stems to keep the plant healthy. the best way to do this is to use clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears and make sure you wipe them off between cuts to avoid spreading any fungal disease that may be present. judiciously pruning the leaves will stimulate new growth if you cut in front of a leaf node. since money tree plants require a lot of water all at once, they can be prone to root rot. root rot, if you're unfamiliar, is when there's too much water in your plant that causes the roots to decay and die. when you're watering your plant, make sure you don't see extra water sitting in the saucer under the drainage holes. if you do, clear it out to avoid root rot. your best bet is to use a pot that isn't too big ( the bigger the pot, the more room it has to hold water ) and has excellent drainage. place it on a saucer that you can easily remove, and dump out when it your use of neem oil is a good idea to ward off insects such as aphids or mealybugs. but, your plant looks a bit tired. perhaps re - potting it with fresh potting soil would perk it up. it's important that you maintain nutrient - rich potting soil with good drainage. to achieve this, you'll want to use a well - draining potting mix with perlite or add some sand and gravel for extra porousness. if the roots are beginning to get crowded and growing through the drainage holes, it definitely needs to be repotted. do this in the spring, using a 2 \\\" bigger pot to keep the roots drier. ( as mentioned above, too big of a pot could cause the soil to dry slower, which is not helpful. ) water your plant in the old pot before transferring over and let sit an hour. place a piece of screening at the bottom of the container over the drainage hole to secure the soil and allow to drain. add soil to the bottom to elevate the root ball. lift the plant andrelease the roots against the existing planter. use a clean knife or garden trowel to wedge between the pot and the soil to loosen. inspect the root ball. notice if there are any dead or rotting roots and trim off with sterile pruners.

Title: My money tree has a problem
My money tree has a problem
My money tree has had some sort of issue with its bark/some leaves dying, this is what it looks like what should I do? #HappyPlants #PlantTherapy #MoneyTree
0ft to light, direct
4” pot with drainage
Last watered 2 years ago
Sadly you may still have root rot. It’s typically caused by a fungal infection that destroys the root system so the plant can no longer absorb water and has to be treated with fungicide. Check and see if the trunk is squishy where it meets the soil, or if the bark feels like it is detached. You can carefully dig around the roots as well and see if any of them have the same symptoms. If it is root rot, it looks like you have a really good chance of saving it! You’ll have to remove it from the pot and trim off any affected (squishy or very soft) areas of the roots with sharp and sterile pruners and thouroughly spray the root system and the rest of the tree with fungicide, I’ve used Captain Jacks Copper Fungicide. Make sure you throw away the old soil and clean everything afterwards so you don’t contaminate any other plants! Typically plant leaves will turn yellow if overwatered and brown if underwatered. Sometimes it’s a pH imbalance that causes browning leaves too. These guys need between 6.0 and 7.5, so slightly acidic to neutral. Tap water is usually around 7. I hope this helps you figure out what’s going on! If it is root rot, I’d suggest a well draining soil mix instead of soil. I make my own and each plant gets something a little different!
@MajorPaparazzi thank you so much for the help, I appreciate this so much you’re a plant saver.
Where’s the drainage? On the liner inside the pot? Do you remove the liner prior to watering and allow the excess to drain before putting it back in the cute decorative pot? If yes, it may be as @MajorPaparazzi said above. If not, it’s the same as stated above. It cold also be that your plant needs to go up to a slightly larger pot because there isn’t enough soil to provide nutrients. When was the last time you fed it? Browning tips have multiple causes however it all starts at the root of the problem. Pun intended. 😁

that is done you will need to spray the entire plant, both above and below the leaves and stems with a commercial fungicide or a homemade solution. if the black spot returns, you may need to spray your roses weekly. if you choose to stay away from chemical sprays, there are many diy methods of treatments. you can make a bordeaux mix which will also help to repel some insect pests. a baking soda and soap spray can also help with powdery mildew issues. neem oil is an organic fungicide and pesticide derived from the seeds of the neem plant. sulfur powder is also an option. canker is characterized by a fungi that infects via openings in the rose ’ s stems or canes. these openings may be the result of pruning or damage to the plant. cankers, or abscesses, develop along the stem and if allowed to continue to grow around the stem, can kill it. to prevent these growths from forming, routinely prune, fertilize, water, and aerate rose bushes ; a healthy plant can resist disease. once infected, however, prune and discard infected material, and treat with sulfur powder, bordeaux mixture, or a commercial fungicide containing copper. cankers are small diseased abscesses ranging in color from black to yellow that grow along rose stems. they may grow significantly as the disease progresses. after observing signs of rose canker, use disinfected shears to prune the diseased canes. continue to do this, cleaning your sheers in between cuts until all of the damaged stems have been trimmed. dispose of the diseased material, and then treat rose with bordeaux mixture, sulfur powder, or a commercial fungicide containing copper. a pathogenic fungus, podosphaera pannosa, causes powdery mildew. if your rose ’ s verdant foliage abruptly looks as if it has been dusted with white or grayish powdered sugar, it ’ s likely your beautiful rose bush has been infected by it. while this disease can hamper a rose ’ s health, especially if it recurs often, if treated promptly with pruning and fungicides, you can significantly minimize the overall risk. prevention measures include providing good air circulation, pruning in spring, keeping the foliage dry, and watering regularly. identifying powdery mildew powdery mildew is characterized by the appearance of a light white or gray powder - like substance on a rose ’ s foliage, stems, and buds. over time the mildew may darken to a brownish color. treating powdery mildew prune diseased canes and remove the infected material using sterilized pruning shears. then, treat with a horticultural oil such as neem oil, sulfur powder, bordeaux mixture, or a fungicide containing copper. \\\" rose diseases. \\\" clemson university cooperative extension service. hgic. clemson. edu \\\" rose diseases : identification and management. \\\" the university of tennessee system. plantsciences. tennessee. edu

Title: Rose Diseases | Plant Addicts
ensure that rose greets you daily with lush, fragrant blooms by supporting its good health. to do this, observe for disease symptoms and treat them when necessary. aim to prevent diseases by providing ample air circulation, practicing good garden hygiene, and keeping up on pruning. common ailments include black spot, canker, and powdery mildew. while bacteria and fungi cause many plant diseases, fungi cause these three. if not treated promptly, they can harm the rose ’ s health and occasionally lead to death. items used to prevent and treat blackspot, canker, and powdery mildew include vinegar, baking soda, bordeaux mixture, commercially made organic fungicides containing copper, and horticultural oils such as neem oil. black spot ( marssonina rosae or diplocarpon rosae ) is a common fungal disease that affects roses. this fungal disease forms black spots all over the foliage of rose bushes causing the leaves to turn yellow and fall off. if left untreated, all of the leaves can fall off and the fungus can weaken the entire rose bush. the spores of black spot travel with the help of water, so black spot disease thrives during cool moist weather conditions. mild wet spring days and moist dewy nights are prime conditions for black spot disease to attack and spread. once the fungus becomes active, it cannot be stopped without fungal controls. prevention and prompt intervention when first spotted are critical to help keep your roses healthy and beautiful. identifying black spot the first signs of black spot will begin to appear on the lower leaves of the rose bush. circular black spots on the upper sides of the leaves will develop. sometimes the spots are so big that they merge together. the diseased leaves will turn yellow and eventually fall off of the plant. if left untreated, the fungus moves upward and the entire plant can lose its leaves. black spot not only affects the leaves of roses but the canes as well. old and new canes can be infected with black spot disease. black spot on canes will look like purple or black dots. once your rose shrub has black spot, even after you have treated the plant, the spots on the leaves will remain until all diseased leaves have fallen off. prevention is key when treating black spot on roses. planting your rose in an area that gets full sunlight will help to keep the leaves dry. spacing out rose bushes allows for good air circulation, which also helps to dry out the foliage and prevent the disease from spreading. pruning the diseased canes is also very important. during the growing season, avoid getting the leaves wet when watering. it is a good idea to spray your roses in the spring with a fungicide and continue treating every two weeks so that new leaves are protected from the start. a combination of baking soda and water can also be applied weekly for prevention. once you see black spots on your rose leaves, you need to address the issue immediately. begin by pruning away all of the infected leaves and infected stems. dispose all of the infected material. once that is done you will need to spray the entire plant, both above and below the leaves and stems with a commercial fungicide or a homemade solution. if the black spot returns, you may need to spray your roses weekly. if you choose to stay away from chemical sprays, there are many diy methods of treatments. you can make a bordeaux mix which will also help to repel some insect

Title: What Causes Begonia Leaves to Curl? (and What to Do About It)
leaves. if you ’ re growing your begonias outdoors and you notice curling leaves, look at other nearby plants of different species. do they have curled leaves, too? or perhaps their foliage is wilting and yellowing? if so, it ’ s highly probable that they ’ ve suffered herbicide injury. even if you didn ’ t apply herbicides in your own garden, it ’ s possible that some wafted over from a neighbor or maybe your local government applied herbicides to public areas nearby. or perhaps you recently treated your lawn? you might wonder if what you are seeing is a result of a pest or disease issue. typically, specific pests or diseases stick to plants in the same genus or family. powdery mildew in legumes, for example, is caused by microsphaera diffusa while in begonias it ’ s caused by oidium begoniae. but if totally unrelated species are symptomatic, the cause is usually something else like a watering issue or herbicide damage. so, if your begonias and nearby hostas are both showing symptoms of leaf curl, it ’ s probably not a pest or disease issue since the plants are from different genera. if you suspect herbicides are the problem, there ’ s not much to do except find where they came from and stop it from happening again. 3. mealybugs or scale sapsuckers like mealybugs and scale cause stress to the begonia, and this stress can result in curling leaves. both scale and mealybugs are fairly easy to identify once you know what to look for. both are oval and flat, and either brown, tan, black, or white with a waxy coating. they like to hang out on the stems and at the leaf joints, so look closely in those areas. these pests don ’ t move much, and they tend to cluster together, so people sometimes mistake them for symptoms of a disease. but try scraping them off and squishing them – if they come off easily or they can be smashed, they are bugs, not symptoms of a disease. i know, gross. if scale or mealybugs are the cause of the leaf curl, you can simply scrape them off the plant using a butter knife or dab them with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol. broad, tropical, or begonia mites ( polyphagotarsonemus latus ) are an invisible monster. they ’ re about 0. 02 millimeters in length, so you won ’ t be able to see them with the naked eye. these pests thrive in the same conditions as begonias, namely warm and humid. you ’ ll find them all over in greenhouses and tropical areas and they feed on many warm - weather species. when the mites feed on the plant, they cause the terminal leaves to curl and roll. they can also cause deformed buds and stunted growth. you can get out a magnifying glass and examine the begonias closely to try and see the mites. they like to hide in areas that are shaded and hidden. if you see them or even suspect an infestation, treat the plant with insecticidal soap. spray once a week with the soap on a day when there is no rain expected if your plants are outside. insecticidal soap is handy to have around since it tackles many insect problems"

User > How to properly replant poorly planted Emerald Green Arborvitae? I came across your article on oregonlive.com titled “Dig again to correct poor tree planting, don't add fertilizer” and while I’ve read countless articles on the same topic, all suggesting different things, I found this article to be the best one due to your comparison of old and new data/research. I planted my emerald green arbs in August but I was determined. I planted them in a new retaining wall berm. I got a load of top soil delivered, planted them so top of root ball was level w/ soil. Watered 1-2 times per day checking soil conditions. They just never seemed to look like they were doing well to me. I tried to take care of them but they just continued to decline. I noticed the soil I had delivered was not suitable and assumed that was the culprit but waited it out a bit checking soil, watering as needed but still declining. Here I am, fairly certain the clay-like soil is the culprit so I’ve been digging about a foot out from the trunk. Some roots look healthy but are growing on top of soil, some are black and rotted. I have some good natural soil I pulled from my front yard that I would like to replant them with. My question.. how do I properly dig them out and replant without completely killing every root I touch? Or is that impossible?

best. these flowers can tolerate dirt, gravel, or any poor soil. they stand tall so the honeybees can see their white glow from afar. there ’ s no need to water these plants daily, as they prefer their soil to be only slightly moist and mostly dry. they ’ re spring flowers and will attract more than just bees to your garden — butterflies love them, too! 4. purple coneflower ( echinacea purpurea ) humans aren ’ t the only ones who love the vibrant purple shade of these coneflowers ; honeybees, hummingbirds, and butterflies will become frequent visitors to your garden after they bloom. as long they have plenty of room to flourish, these flowers can grow up to five feet tall. they require full sun and heaps of water, but their upkeep is well worth the return. 5. joe - pye weed ( eutrochium purpureum ) spring and summer gardens are great for your honeybees, but fall flowers matter too. joe - pye weed thrives in the cooler months, and its highly aromatic scents will attract all types of pollinators ( hummingbirds included ). 6. wrinkleleaf goldenrod ( solidago rugosa ) another flower that thrives in the fall months is the wrinkleleaf goldenrod. their vibrant yellow colors won ’ t wilt away from a little cool weather or rough soil. they ’ re durable and can thrive in many environments — another great option if you don ’ t have the greenest thumb on your block. planting bee - friendly flowers, such as bee balm, coral honeysuckle, white wild indigo, purple coneflower, joe - pye weed, and wrinkleleaf goldenrod, can help support honeybees and other pollinators. these plants provide nectar and pollen, attracting bees to your garden and helping to sustain their populations. how do i garden for bees? if the purpose of your garden is to attract plenty of bees to your yard, then there are a few rules you should follow for optimal results. do : plant in large patches. planting your flowers too far apart will double the bees ’ foraging time. so, always plant in large clusters, only three to five feet apart, giving them plenty of blossoms to work with. do : plant a wide variety of plant species. as long the species you plant are native to your region and will thrive in your environment, plant a wide variety of plants — the more, the merrier. most bee species like to have variety wherever they decide to feast, so having plenty of plants to choose from is key. that said, western honeybees ( apis mellifera ) harvest primarily from the manuka tea tree because of it ’ s availability and flowering season. at manukora, our honeybees have access to an abundant forest of manuka tea trees to feast on. while they may wander to other plants, we test all of our honey to ensure that it is monofloral ( only from the local manuka flowers ). in fact, you can check any manukora honey product for a unique qr code. by scanning this code, you can learn about the hive your honey came from, the beekeeper responsible for the bees ’ care, and the exact potency results for each batch. these results include mgo, leptosperin, and other markers used by the ministry for primary"

User > Why is my Alberta Spruce tree dying? I planted the tree in December 2019. In 2020 one half of the needles died. The tree is in a raised bed and the soil is organic mixed with leaves. There is also clover, yarrow, grasses, shrubs, and small lilac bush starts in the raised bed. I try to keep the lilac bush starts pulled. There is mulch around the base. The tree is watered with a lawn sprinkler 2-3 times per week. When it is dry between lawn watering I supplement with approximately a gallon or two of water. The tree was about 16" tall when I received it. 4" was new growth. All the new growth died so it is about 12" now. Should I purchase organic top soil mixed with fertilizer now? Would that help during the dry cold winters? Note: Picture should be labeled Alberta Spruce not Alberta Blue Spruce.

Title: How to Grow and Care for the Dwarf Alberta Spruce
/ evgeniya vlasova credit : the spruce / evgeniya vlasova credit : the spruce / evgeniya vlasova credit : the spruce / evgeniya vlasova planting plant seeds in late spring or early fall. after a cold period and the temperature begins to warm, it triggers germination and new growth. the planting hole should be twice as wide as the tree's container and about 2 inches deeper. water thoroughly after planting and cover the ground around the tree with a thick layer of shredded bark mulch. for the first year, water the tree weekly, saturating the soil to a depth of at least 3 inches. these plants can eventually outgrow a small space, so avoid planting in a spot that cannot comfortably accommodate a 10 - to 13 - foot tree. light the dwarf alberta spruce needs full sun to perform at its best but it will tolerate some shade. give these plants an eastern or northern exposure. avoid planting where harsh winter winds or hot afternoon sun can burn them. soil grow dwarf alberta spruce in moist, well - drained soil. it does best in soil that is slightly acid to alkaline in ph. these plants work well with regular potting soil with added peat moss. cover with shredded bark mulch. water water dwarf alberta spruce when the top 3 inches of soil is dry. if you keep this plant in containers, water it more often than you would water in - ground plants. these plants do not like soggy soil, so beware of overwatering. temperature and humidity dwarf alberta spruce performs best in areas with cold winters and cool summers. this plant does best in low - humidity environments. this mini tree requires good air circulation. fertilizer young plants respond well to mixing in a granular fertilizer around the tree's base once a year. for an organic alternative, try a natural fertilizer like fish emulsion. mature trees require no feeding. types of dwarf alberta spruce larger forms of white spruce can grow up to 100 feet tall and live for 250 to 300 years. the dwarf varieties can be used as container plants or specimen planting. spruce trees are popular for providing year - round color in your landscape. picea glauca'jean's dilly': this shorter form of alberta spruce ( up to 5 feet tall ) has needles that are concentrated at the ends of each season's short stem growth and a distinctive twist to the needles. picea glauca'rainbow's end': this type grows up to 10 feet tall with a second flush of growth in the midseason with yellowish - green to creamy yellow - colored foliage. picea glauca'tiny tower': featuring an excellent pyramidal form with a dwarf habit that is perfect for smaller gardens, its dense, bright green foliage turns an attractive gray - green and is well - suited as a formal topiary. it will grow to reach 8 - 10 inches tall. picea glauca'elf': this is a dense tree with thin, short needles. it is very slow - growing and is ideal in containers. it will grow to about 12 inches tall. picea glauca'hobbit': this evergreen shrub is dense with small green needles. it can reach up to 2 - 3 feet tallpicea glauca'little globe': this is a dense variety with tiny dark green needles and large buds. in maturity, it will reach 18 - 24 inches. pruning pruning is not necessary with dwarf alberta spruce since it grows so slowly. damaged branches should be removed whenever you find them. pruning can be done in late winter or early spring when new growth appears. cut no more than 2 to 3 inches off the tips of the branches. you can keep a dwarf alberta spruce small by trimming it into a topiary form when grown in a container. pruning tip looking for the best pruners for your alberta spruce? we tested over 10 top - rated pruning shears in our lab to make sure your spruces stay happy and healthy. propagating dwarf alberta spruce you can propagate dwarf alberta spruce from seeds or branch cuttings. the quickest way to propagate this plant is by using a 6 - inch - long softwood branch cutting taken in late summer or early fall. softwood branches are long and firm branches, and should not be hardened and woody. here's how to propagate dwarf alberta spruce via cuttings : gather sterilized pruners, potting soil mixed with peat moss and sand, a 3 - inch pot, and a brightly lit location for the cutting to grow. strip the needles from the lower two - thirds of the branch. dip the cut end into the rooting hormone to promote rooting, then plant it deeply into the soil. keep the soil moist until roots form. as a slow - growing plant, root formation can take up to 6 to 8 weeks. you'll know the plant is rooting when you notice some new plant growth. once you notice new growth, transplant it into a larger pot or a landscape location. how to grow dwarf alberta spruce from seed if you have access to a dwarf alberta spruce tree, harvest seeds mid - fall. spruce seeds grow in cones. pick them young before they ripen. extract the seeds from the cones by allowing the cones to dry out, open, and spill out the seeds. this can take up to two weeks. promote germination yourself some people like to scar or weaken the outer coating of the seed to promote germination. these seeds also need temperatures to cool and warm up to make the seed believe the winter season ( and dormancy ) is ending and the growing season is about to begin. starting seeds indoors if you are starting your seed indoors, plant the seeds about 1 / 4 - inch deep in a pot with moistened potting soil amended with peat moss and sand, wrapped in a plastic bag in the back of a refrigerator for about three to four months. gradually warm up the seeds by moving the pot to a cool garage or basement or taking it outside, periodically hardening off over four weeks as spring approaches, and giving the plant at least six to eight hours of light. growing seeds outdoors alternatively, you can also leave the newly potted seed outdoors ( sheltered in a non - windy area ) during the winter months. the seed will enter dormancy and naturally acclimate to the warming temperatures when spring returns.

User > Tree-age? I discovered today that something catastrophic has happened to an English walnut I planted last spring. I'm not entirely certain what happened (pictures attached), but my best theory is that the strong winds yesterday and today were enough to catch the tree's deer cage on the tree itself and which subsequently was thrashed about until the upper portion of the tree itself sheared off completely. There's also now about a 2-inch gap around the trunk/root in the dirt which has also appeared. The tree was happy and healthy before this occurred! What can I do to save this tree? Anything? I've re-filled the hole around the roots as best as I could with minimal disturbance to the tree itself. I also saved the top half of the tree which is mostly undamaged (albeit violently removed from the base of the tree); I've submerged the lower part of the branch in water in an effort to keep it hydrated as there are a lot of growing buds here. Is there anything I can do at this point to either a) help the base tree which is still in the ground survive and re-grow, or b) establish a root system on the upper half of the tree and re-plant somewhere? I'm going to leave the trunk base in the ground and hope for the best if nothing else. But I'm intensely curious if it has any chance of coming back?

[ 6 ] - this keeps your tree healthy as it continues to grow and produce walnuts. - you can use your garden shears, as these branches shouldn ’ t be very thick. remove any forked or crossing branches to keep your tree healthy. as new branches grow, they may take a forked appearance or may start to grow across one another. if you notice any forked or crossed branches, cut them off using your garden shears or hand saw. make your cut as close to the trunk of the tree as you can, and use a 45 - degree angle as you cut. [ 7 ] - if you ’ d like, you can remove the smaller of the forked branches and keep the larger section. do this if the branch is towards the top middle of the tree and if it looks attractive. use garden shears to cut branches up to 2 in ( 5. 1 cm ) thick. when trimming thin branches, you can easily use a pair of garden shears. do this if the branch is about 1⁄2 – 2 in ( 1. 3 – 5. 1 cm ). to cut, simply place your shears where the branch meets the trunk and make your snip. [ 8 ] - garden shears are small, handheld tools used to cut off branches or stems. - before you start, disinfect your tools with a diluted bleach solution or rubbing alcohol. this will help prevent the spread of disease. remove branches with a hand saw if they are 2 – 6 in ( 5. 1 – 15. 2 cm ) thick. if your tree has branches between 2 – 4 in ( 5. 1 – 10. 2 cm ) thick, a hand saw works well to chop off your branches. position the saw where the branch meets the tree trunk, and quickly move it back and forth until the branch falls off. [ 9 ] - if you use gardening shears on thick branches, you can injure yourself or the tree. it will also damage your gardening shears. - when using the saw, keep the blade away from your body to prevent injuries. - be careful with falling branches. before you make cuts, plan how they will fall, making sure they won't damage structures, vehicles, or outdoor items. additionally, people should be at a safe distance to avoid injury. use a chainsaw to remove large, thick branches over 6 in ( 15 cm ) thick. if you are removing large branches from mature trees, the safest option is to use a chainsaw. hold the chainsaw firmly, and bring it straight down through the branch to make your cut. be sure the ground is clear beneath the branch so it does not damage anything or anyone as it falls. [ 10 ] - wear safety goggles, hold the chainsaw away from your body, and handle the chainsaw with care to keep yourself protected. - ask a spotter to help you cut the branch. - before you start cutting, plan an escape route in case things go wrong. you need to be able to escape the falling branch. - if you are not experienced with a chainsaw, hiring a professional may be a safer option. climb a ladder or forklift to help you reach branches on tall trees. if you are trimming branches from mature trees, it may be difficult to reach the branches high above. set up a full - size ladder next to the tree, and climb up with your tool to get rid of your branches. if your tree is extremely tall, rent a forklift from a home supply store, follow all operational directions, and use the forklift to access the top of your tree. always have someone spot you in case of injuries. [ 11 ] - do this if you are comfortable with heights and experienced with using similar tools and equipment. if you are not familiar with heavy machinery or landscaping equipment, it may be safer to hire a professional arborist. hire a professional if you have a very large walnut tree. pruning large trees takes precision, sharp tools, and the ability to reach high above. if you have a large walnut tree and cannot reach the top, your safest option may be to hire a professional. to do this, search online for “ hire tree cutter ” or “ local arborist companies, ” and browse your options. then, contact the company and discuss your pruning needs and tree height. the arborist can come and trim your trees safely for you, so you don ’ t have to worry about hurting yourself or harming the tree. [ 12 ] - this is a great idea if you aren ’ t very familiar with pruning walnut trees or are afraid of heights. while it is not hard to prune walnut trees, it can be difficult to access the top of the tree. - for best results, consider hiring a professional after your branches reach 3 in ( 7. 6 cm ) or more in diameter. questionwhen is the right time to prune? i live in the southern hemisphere. donagantop answererprune in late winter before leaves appear. be prepared for some sap flow afterward. this doesn't hurt the tree. removing branches when the tree is young is much easier and more visually appealing than waiting until the tree matures. thanks - be extremely careful when cutting branches from high above. if you are in doubt, the best option is to hire a professional. thanks - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / y9g3mzub4u8? t = 3m8s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / y9g3mzub4u8? t = 3m43s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / y9g3mzub4u8? t = 3m26s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 34s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 34s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 1m27s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 1m27s - ↑ https : / / www. youtube. com / watch? v = y9g3mzub4u8\",

[ 1 ] - this way, your tree can direct all its nutrients to this topmost branch. remove branches thicker than ⅓ of your trunk ’ s thickness. when pruning walnut trees, observe the \\\" 3 - to - 1 rule. \\\" examine the thickness of your trunk, and use this as a guide when deciding which branches to keep and which to remove. if you find a branch larger than ⅓ of the trunk's diameter, cut it off at a 45 - degree angle. this way, your branches will all receive a balanced amount of nutrients and grow healthy and strong. [ 2 ] - if your tree has more than 1 thick branch, then it will be harder for the other branches to grow and develop walnuts. if you keep branches that are on the thicker side, they can unevenly drain the nutrients from the tree and grow too thick. cut off any forked branches either into a single shoot or at the trunk. a forked branch is a shoot with a split in the branch, causing 2 branches to grow from the main branch. these branches require more nutrients from the tree, and they often act as leeches from the other branches receiving vital nutrients. to prevent this, you can either cut off 1 side of the branch to make a single shoot, or you can cut off the branch entirely. [ 3 ] - both options will help your tree better conserve nutrients. - if you already have many adequate branches, you may want to simply remove the branch completely. if you have a few sparse branches, trim off the smaller of the forked sides. trim off branches that cross or rub together to keep your tree healthy. inspect the framework of your tree, and look for any branches that have intersecting paths or touch together. these branches are cosmetically unattractive, and they often make the inner skeleton of your tree bulky and hard to access. as a result, your tree may not grow as many walnuts. to prevent this, cut off these branches where they meet the trunk of the tree. [ 4 ] - this way, your tree only grows outward - facing, healthy branches. - this keeps the tree invigorated, so it can put more energy into fewer branches. remove any low - hanging and damaged branches to shape your tree. cut off any branches that are below 4 – 5 ft ( 1. 2 – 1. 5 m ) or so. low - hanging branches take away from the rounded look of your tree. in addition, get rid of any discolored or thin branches. small and damaged branches drain nutrients from your tree. cut your branches at a 45 - degree angle so you minimally damage the tree. [ 5 ] - these branches take away from the overall look and shape of the tree, and since they are not very strong, they likely will not grow walnuts. pruning mature trees prune mature trees once every 3 - 5 years to preserve their shape. when pruning young trees, you create the shape and structure of the tree for its entire life. your later prunings are to maintain the structure and polish up the appearance of your tree. to do this, look for any new, fresh branches and cut them off with your garden shears. cut off low or damaged branches to maintain the central leader shape. just like you did when pruning your young trees, inspect your trees for branches below 4 – 5 ft ( 1. 2 – 1. 5 m ), and look for any damaged branches or discolored areas. if you find any low - hanging or sickly branches, cut them off at a 45 - degree angle near the trunk. [ 6 ] - this keeps your tree healthy as it continues to grow and produce walnuts. - you can use your garden shears, as these branches shouldn ’ t be very thick. remove any forked or crossing branches to keep your tree healthy. as new branches grow, they may take a forked appearance or may start to grow across one another. if you notice any forked or crossed branches, cut them off using your garden shears or hand saw. make your cut as close to the trunk of the tree as you can, and use a 45 - degree angle as you cut. [ 7 ] - if you ’ d like, you can remove the smaller of the forked branches and keep the larger section. do this if the branch is towards the top middle of the tree and if it looks attractive. use garden shears to cut branches up to 2 in ( 5. 1 cm ) thick. when trimming thin branches, you can easily use a pair of garden shears. do this if the branch is about 1⁄2 – 2 in ( 1. 3 – 5. 1 cm ). to cut, simply place your shears where the branch meets the trunk and make your snip.

[ 9 ] - if you use gardening shears on thick branches, you can injure yourself or the tree. it will also damage your gardening shears. - when using the saw, keep the blade away from your body to prevent injuries. - be careful with falling branches. before you make cuts, plan how they will fall, making sure they won't damage structures, vehicles, or outdoor items. additionally, people should be at a safe distance to avoid injury. use a chainsaw to remove large, thick branches over 6 in ( 15 cm ) thick. if you are removing large branches from mature trees, the safest option is to use a chainsaw. hold the chainsaw firmly, and bring it straight down through the branch to make your cut. be sure the ground is clear beneath the branch so it does not damage anything or anyone as it falls. [ 10 ] - wear safety goggles, hold the chainsaw away from your body, and handle the chainsaw with care to keep yourself protected. - ask a spotter to help you cut the branch. - before you start cutting, plan an escape route in case things go wrong. you need to be able to escape the falling branch. - if you are not experienced with a chainsaw, hiring a professional may be a safer option. climb a ladder or forklift to help you reach branches on tall trees. if you are trimming branches from mature trees, it may be difficult to reach the branches high above. set up a full - size ladder next to the tree, and climb up with your tool to get rid of your branches. if your tree is extremely tall, rent a forklift from a home supply store, follow all operational directions, and use the forklift to access the top of your tree. always have someone spot you in case of injuries. [ 11 ] - do this if you are comfortable with heights and experienced with using similar tools and equipment. if you are not familiar with heavy machinery or landscaping equipment, it may be safer to hire a professional arborist. hire a professional if you have a very large walnut tree. pruning large trees takes precision, sharp tools, and the ability to reach high above. if you have a large walnut tree and cannot reach the top, your safest option may be to hire a professional. to do this, search online for “ hire tree cutter ” or “ local arborist companies, ” and browse your options. then, contact the company and discuss your pruning needs and tree height. the arborist can come and trim your trees safely for you, so you don ’ t have to worry about hurting yourself or harming the tree. [ 12 ] - this is a great idea if you aren ’ t very familiar with pruning walnut trees or are afraid of heights. while it is not hard to prune walnut trees, it can be difficult to access the top of the tree. - for best results, consider hiring a professional after your branches reach 3 in ( 7. 6 cm ) or more in diameter. questionwhen is the right time to prune? i live in the southern hemisphere. donagantop answererprune in late winter before leaves appear. be prepared for some sap flow afterward. this doesn't hurt the tree. removing branches when the tree is young is much easier and more visually appealing than waiting until the tree matures. thanks - be extremely careful when cutting branches from high above. if you are in doubt, the best option is to hire a professional. thanks - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / y9g3mzub4u8? t = 3m8s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / y9g3mzub4u8? t = 3m43s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / y9g3mzub4u8? t = 3m26s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 34s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 34s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 1m27s - ↑ https : / / youtu. be / xlc8odlnq7c? t = 1m27s - ↑ https : / / www. youtube. com / watch? v = y9g3mzub4u8",

User > Painters want me to trim Hydrangeas as I am having my home painted, and the crew has asked me to trim back my plants prior to doing the work. I have hasta, but I'm not too worried about them. My main worry is my Annabelle hydrangeas. Obviously, our season is nearly done so my main concern is damaging them for future years. Any advice on how and where to trim them to help my paint crew, while also preserving them to the best extent possible, especially for next year?

Title: When & How to Prune Hydrangeas - Guides & Tips
\n\nwhen & how to prune your hydrangea one of the most commonly asked questions when it comes to proper hydrangea care, is when and how to prune hydrangeas. let ’ s delve into that question here using three simple steps. itching to prune your hydrangeas? follow these 3 steps to ensure your success. step 1 : identify which type of hydrangea you have. most hydrangeas sold in north america fall into one of five types : bigleaf, mountain, smooth, panicle and oakleaf. some form their flower buds on old wood, meaning next summer's buds are already present on the branches in fall and winter. others form their flower buds on new wood, once they begin to grow in spring. this is why it's so important to identify which type of hydrangea you have before you prune, as part of proper hydrangea pruning steps : you could inadvertently cut off flower buds and remove all of the blooms for the season. while that doesn't harm the plant, it's definitely disappointing. to help identify which type of hydrangeas you have, follow the detailed explanation of hydrangea pruning guides and steps on when and how to prune hydrangeas. step 2 : decide when to prune your hydrangea. once you have completed step one, you will know which type of hydrangea you are growing. then, follow this hydrangea pruning guide to decide when to prune hydrangeas. pruning hydrangeas that bloom on old wood most shrubs that bloom on old wood should be pruned immediately after they are done flowering. however, hydrangeas that bloom on old wood finish flowering so late in the season that pruning them after they bloom doesn ’ t leave enough time for them to regrow and form flower buds for next year. that ’ s why, for better hydrangea pruning tips, we suggest that you avoid pruning this type of hydrangea except to remove any completely dead branches in the spring once the plant starts to leaf out. examples of hydrangeas that bloom exclusively on old wood include : - all oakleaf hydrangeas - bigleaf hydrangeas that are not rebloomers - mountain hydrangeas that are not rebloomers pruning hydrangeas that bloom on new wood knowing when to prune hydrangeas that bloom on new wood can be safelydone in late fall once the plants have gone dormant or in early spring. next year ’ s flower buds won ’ t be formed until late spring the same year they bloom, so there is no risk of removing the buds if you prune in fall or spring. if you like the look of dried flower heads in your garden in the wintertime, leave them on and prune them in spring. if you live somewhere there is a heavy snow load or if you prefer a tidier look in winter, another hydrangea pruning guide on how and when to prune hydrangeas is in late fall to early winter. examples of hydrangeas that bloom exclusively on new wood include : - all smooth hydrangeas - all panicle hydrangeas pruning reblooming hydrangeas reblooming hydrangeas produce flowers on both old and new wood. that makes it tough to find the best time, on when to prune hydrangeas, typically late fall or early spring. you can see in the close up picture above taken in october that the buds have not yet been formed. they will form their buds in late spring to early summer and bloom later that same year. traits of oakleaf hydrangeas ( hydrangea quercifolia ) oakleaf hydrangeas are usually the first hydrangeas to bloom in early summer. they bear large, white, cone - shaped flowers on strong, cinnamon colored stems above a mound of large, textured, oak - shaped leaves. the blossoms often take on pink or red tones in the fall and turn a tawny brown for winter. typically, oakleaf hydrangeas do not rebloom, which affects when and how to prune hydrangeas for this type. though they develop more slowly than other types, a grouping of mature oakleaf hydrangeas in bloom is a sight to behold and will be a delight for decades to come. oakleaf hydrangeas set their flower buds on old wood, which means they form their flower buds for next summer in the leaf axils of the stems the summer before they bloom. in the close - up picture above taken in october, you can see the large terminal bud at the top of the stem and several smaller buds in the leaf axils down the stem are already formed for next year, which is key to understanding how to prune hydrangeas. - explore our hydrangeas demystified guide. - watch a video on how to identify your hydrangea. - video : why didn ’ t my hydrangea bloom? - video : how to prune your hydrangea standard - see all proven winners hydrangeas
Title: How To Grow And Care For Paper Bush (Edgeworthia Chrysantha)
\n\nfeet of space so it has room to grow. young shrubs don't require any pruning except to remove dead or diseased foliage. as paper bush plants mature, the shrub produces plant suckers, an unintended branch, or new growth that adds more stress to the plant. prune plant suckers away from the primary branch structure. keeping paper bush plants healthy as they are established will help promote better results in the future. if pruning to adjust the plant's shape or appearance, wait until after blooming to remove branches. summer isn't a downtime for the paper bush. after it finishes blooming, it cloaks itself with very handsome foliage reminiscent of plumeria. long, narrow, leathery, blue - green leaves up to 10 inches long give the shrub a tropical look. propagating paper bush plants while your paper bush may set seed in the spring, germination is difficult and can take a year or longer. the easiest way to propagate paper bush plants is by replanting suckers when you prune, making sure to preserve roots on the suckers. but you can also propagate with cuttings in the summer. here's how to propagate the paper bush plant with stem cuttings : select woody and semi - ripe nodal stems to cut using pruning shears or a sharp knife. remove leaves on the lower 2 / 3 of the stems, then dip the tip in rooting hormone powder. add cutting to a well - watered container filled with organically - rich soil. gently pack the cuttings, ensuring the entire bottom of the selection is below the top of the soil. place in indirect sunlight and new roots should emerge within weeks. potting and repotting paper bush paper bush is a large plant that may quickly outgrow containers, so it's best planted in the ground. but you can grow it in a pot initially or if you live in a climate that is outside of its hardiness range. use a large container with drainage holes and fill with organically rich, well - draining potting mix. plant so that the root ball is level with the top of the soil, then water well. overwintering adding a layer of organic mulch can protect the plant's roots and help retain moisture. consider placing the plant along a south or west - facing wall to protect against frost and frigid winter winds. if you decide to plant your paper bush in a container, move it to a protected area in winter that isn't subjected to severe cold. the ground provides insulation that containers cannot. consider using row covers or frost blankets to protect your paper bush during unexpected cold snaps. positioning your plant near buildings or using windbreaks can also help shield it from harsh winds. common pests & plant diseases this easy - to - maintain shrub does not have many pest or disease issues. occasionally, paper bush plants are susceptible to earwigs when the soil becomes too damp. spray soap and water solution to get rid of the infestation. other issues include root rot - related issues from using poorly draining soil. leaf curl or drop occurs when plants are over - or under - watered. ensure your paper bush is planted in well - draining soil to avoid root rot, which can occur if the soil remains too wet. how to get paper bush to bloom although it's an attractive plant throughout the year, paper bush, a perennial,

User > We planted a Redbud tree, potentially affected by Verticillium Wilt. During the second summer, the leaves began to randomly yellow and fall off. The tree was covered with netting during cicada season. A meter indicated the soil pH and water were good. Mid-summer, new leaves appeared, but then yellowed, wilted, and died. This spring, there is no indication of life. A Google search seems to indicate Verticillium Wilt. We would like to have a tree in this location. Our neighborhood association gifted us a new Redbud and Dogwood. Can we replant in this location? If this is Verticillium Wilt, can we help the soil?

Title: What’s Wrong with our Redbud? – Piedmont Master Gardeners

and diseased tissue ; i. e., a branch that contains a “ junction of healthy ( white ) and diseased ( brown to reddish - brown ) tissue. ” this type of sample is essential for diagnosis. the next suspect on my list was verticillium wilt, another fungal disease that affects many trees and ornamental shrubs, and for which there is no cure. it can be caused by two different fungi, both of which reside in the soil, and sadly, can persist in the soil for a long time, infecting new plantings. the verticillium pathogen infects trees via roots and basically blocks the tree ’ s vascular system, preventing the transport of water and nutrients, leading to dieback and death. just like botryosphaeria, this disease is less likely to infect trees that have optimum growing conditions. my redbud had the usual symptoms of verticillium wilt : “ wilted, shriveled, scorched or browning leaves ; off - color foliage ; stunting ; defoliation ; dieback and death. ” verticillium wilt of shade trees and woody ornamentals / va tech. reading about verticillium wilt was a rather scary experience because my redbud is surrounded by much - loved perennials that could be infected. even if the disease progression could be slowed by careful watering during summer ’ s dry periods, transplanting those perennials would simply spread the pathogen to a new area of the garden. on top of the spreading - through - the - soil issue, there ’ s even a problem with removing an infected tree — which is recommended if most of the tree appears to be sick. the remains cannot be composted or chopped into mulch ( also contagious ) and must be landfilled — but not in an area where free mulch is being prepared! all of these contagion problems dictate that only resistant species be planted in areas where verticillium has been diagnosed. for a list of resistant or immune species, as well as a list of susceptible species, see verticillium wilt of shade trees and woody ornamentals. verticillium wilts also affects a number of vegetable crops, though mostly in areas north of us. see verticillium wilt of vegetables / univ. md. ext. next on the list of suspects was vascular streak dieback, a disease that appeared in parts of the united states in the past two years, and which had formerly been known only as a disease of cacao plants in southeast asia. in virginia, it has been redbud, maple, and dogwood that have been apparent victims of vascular streak dieback ( “ vsd ” ). scientists are scrambling to learn more about vsd, and so far have not been able to make a positive identification of the cause. here ’ s a summary recently prepared by a group of virginia tech researchers : in the past two years, nurseries in virginia and some other states have observed wilt and severe dieback on redbud, maple, and dogwood stock ( beckerman et al. 2022 ). in some cases, 90 - 100 % of stock was unsellable due to the extent of damage. early symptoms include leaf chlorosis, scorched leaf margins, and stunting and / or wilting of current year ’ s growth, eventually leading to death of individual branches and progression into the main stem. wilting typically starts on the top of the plant and progresses downwards into and along the main stem. streaking or discoloration within the vascular, or water conducting, tissue occurs when symptomatic branches and / or main stems are cut. however, vascular symptoms may be subtle or absent on dogwood or other hosts, adding a challenge for diagnosis. commonly, opportunistic fungi such as botryosphaeria and phomopsis colonize the weakened branches and cause cankers, adding another challenge for detection of the primary causal agent. the fungus ceratobasidium theobromae ( synonym : rhizoctonia theobromae ) has been consistently associated with vascular tissue of nursery stock showing the symptoms described above. this fungus has previously been reported as the cause of vascular streak dieback ( vsd ) on cacao in southeast asia ( samuels et al. 2012 ). therefore, plant pathologists in the united states are calling the putative disease vsd. — vascular streak dieback : an emerging problem on woody ornamentals in the u. s. scientists are advising that trees diagnosed with c. theobromae be removed and incinerated. they are also suggesting that healthy plants might be protected from infection through the use of systemic fungicide soil drenches that are labeled for management of rhizoctonia. to learn more about vsd, you ’ ll want to read vascular streak dieback : an emerging problem on woody ornamentals in the u. s., which also provides detailed guidance on how to take a sample for diagnosis by the virginia tech plant problem clinic. after studying the three suspects and numerous photos of each disease, it became clear that professional help was needed. so, i followed the directions for taking samples of branches and soil and took them all to the extension office, where staffers mailed them to the plant disease clinic at virginia tech. when an email from the clinic landed in my inbox, i took some deep breaths and opened it. which of the suspects was it? none of them! that ’ s right, dear reader. our redbud was a victim of a problem i had not even considered : decay. the report very helpfully detailed the testing that had been done and concluded as follows : based on the damage and appearance of the trunk in the photo submitted, i think there is very likely decay in the main trunk of this tree. many different fungi cause wood decay. most decay fungi enter through wounds ( e. g. planting wounds, lawn mower, weed whacker, etc. ) on stressed trees. – plant specimen diagnostic report # 2023 - 248 redbud i was quite surprised by the report, but also relieved. although our redbud will eventually succumb to the decay, the end will not be immediate. and i was relieved that nearby plants were not in danger of catching a case of verticillium wilt. frankly, i learned a great deal from this experience. there are a lot of fungal diseases out there, but if you protect your trees and shrubs from stress, they will likely be able to avoid them. if you do spot a problem, take advantage of the diagnostic expertise available from the university serving your extension office. you ’ ll be glad you did!

User > Regarding the health of a Tatarian maple, I planted a Tatarian (hot wings) maple in my backyard in September 2017. Every spring it leafs out and gets beautiful red samaras which then fade in August. But before that, many leaves start to look diseased and fall off. The leaves grow mostly on the lower branches and on the tips of the upper branches, so the mid-crown of the tree looks quite moth-eaten by this time of year. This tree lives in Pueblo and the soil here is quite poor, but 3 other trees in the backyard - a greenspire linden, a Canada red cherry and a honey locust - are doing well. What does the tree need? Soil amendment? Pruning? Some herbicide?

Title: Acer tataricum - Wikipedia
Acer tataricum, the Tatar maple or Tatarian maple, is a species of maple widespread across central and southeastern Europe and temperate Asia, from Austria and Turkey, and in some circumscriptions, with a disjunct population in eastern Asia in northern and central China, Japan and the Russian Far East. The species is named after the Tatar peoples of southern Russia; the tree's name is similarly commonly also misspelled “tartar” or “tartarian” in English.

Acer tataricum is a deciduous spreading shrub or small tree growing to 4–12 metres (13–39 ft) tall, with a short trunk up to 20–50 centimetres (7.9–19.7 in) diameter and slender branches. The bark is thin, pale brown, and smooth at first but becoming shallowly fissured on old plants. The leaves are opposite and simple, broadly ovate, 4.5–10 centimetres (1.8–3.9 in) long and 3–7 centimetres (1.2–2.8 in) broad, unlobed or with three or five shallow lobes, and matt green above; the leaf margin is coarsely and irregularly toothed; the leaf petiole is slender, often pink-tinged, 2–5 centimetres (0.79–1.97 in) long. The flowers are whitish-green, 5–8 millimetres (0.20–0.31 in) diameter, produced in spreading panicles in spring as the leaves open. The fruit is a paired reddish samara, 10–12 millimetres (0.39–0.47 in) long with a 2–3 centimetres (0.79–1.18 in) wing, maturing in late summer to early autumn.

Acer tataricum subsp. aidzuense (Franch.) P. C. De Jong. Japan. Included in Amur maple when that is treated as a separate species.
Acer tataricum subsp. ginnala (Maxim.) Wesm. (Amur maple, syn. Acer ginnala). Korea, easternmost Mongolia, eastern Russia, northeastern China
Acer tataricum subsp. semenovii (Regel & Herder) A. E. Murray. Central Asia in Afghanistan, southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, westernmost Tibet
Acer tataricum subsp. tataricum. Caucasus, Turkey, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Iran
Acer tataricum subsp. theiferum (W. P. Fang) Y. S. Chen & P. C. De Jong. Eastern China. Included in Amur maple when that is treated as a separate species.

Some botanists treat Acer tataricum subsp. ginnala as a separate species Acer ginnala. The two differ conspicuously in the glossy, deeply lobed leaves of A. ginnala, compared to the matt, unlobed or only shallowly lobed leaves of A. tataricum, and are separated by a roughly 3,000 km range gap.

Tatar maple is occasionally grown as an ornamental plant in gardens throughout Europe and also in North America. In Russia, it is valued in farmland shelterbelts. It is locally naturalised and sometimes invasive in eastern North America.

User > Identification of Weeds and How to Kill Them: Even though I have my lawn fertilized and have legal weed killer that is allowed by my county and state applied, I have seen three new types of weeds appearing this summer in my lawn. I have attached three pictures of the new weeds. Could you identify these new weed types for me? What steps are available to me to eradicate these weeds from my lawn and what options do I have in controlling these weeds from spreading throughout my lawn?

User > I have a partly shady yard, and I am considering planting micro-clover pipolona. I just read about microClover pipolina and would love to get that mixed into my lawn. However, I’ve noticed Bent grass has creeped in. Since they both spread carpet form, would they be able to reside together? Is the Bent grass destined to take over? I’m concerned it’s going to get into my garden beds and/or take over. Any suggestions to optimize my yard for alternative turf plantings?

your local county extension service can perform a soil test for you, or you can use one of our digital soil ph meters. if your soil is too acidic, mix in ground limestone ; if it ’ s too alkaline, add peat moss. how to prepare your soil roots will grow faster when they have ample space, and a larger root system means a bigger garlic bulb! after you have amended the soil ph and / or any nutrient / mineral deficiencies ( if needed ), prepare the area in which you want to grow your garlic by removing the soil to a depth of at least 8 \\\". to loosen the pile of soil you ’ ve dug out, mix composted cow manure, garden compost or peat moss ( up to 1 / 3 concentration ) into your excavated soil. make sure the peat moss you get is either baled sphagnum or granular peat. you can also add our coco - fiber potting medium or 2 or more inches of organic material and evenly work it into your soil. organic materials bind sandy soil particles so they retain moisture and nutrients better. they also break apart clay and silt particles, so that water can infiltrate and roots can spread. your lawn can provide you with ideal organic materials such as grass clippings ( not treated with herbicides ) and shredded leaves. not only will the grass and leaves break down to provide soil nutrients, but they will help loosen the soil as well. you can gather these in the fall with spring planting in mind. common soil amendments : * compost * sand * composted manure * lime * peat moss ( either baled sphagnum or granular peat ) garlic grows best when fertilizer is added into the planting hole before planting, vs. being sprinkled on top of the soil after planting. after you amend the soil and dig your trench / patch, evenly sprinkle 1 / 2 cup of balanced fertilizer that is slightly nitrogen - heavy for every 10 linear feet of soil. ( nitrogen is the first number on the fertilizer package. choose a brand with a first number that ’ s higher than the other two, like 15 - 10 - 5 or 20 - 10 - 10. ) add back enough soil to create the correct planting depth ( as described in the how deep to plant section of the planting article ). once your soil is properly prepared, you are ready to plant!"

EVIDENCE:
Black rot is occasionally a problem on Minnesota apple trees. This fungal disease causes leaf spot, fruit rot and cankers on branches. Trees are more likely to be infected if they are: - not fully hardy in Minnesota. - infected with fire blight. - stressed by environmental factors like drought. - manage black rot by practicing good sanitation, taking good care of your trees and pruning your trees correctly. - fungicides are rarely needed to manage black rot. How to identify black rot - large brown rotten areas can form anywhere on the fruit but are most common on the blossom end. - brown to black concentric rings can often be seen on larger infections. - the flesh of the apple is brown but remains firm. - small, black spots can be seen on older fruit infections. These are fungal spore producing structures, called pycnidia. - some fruit mummify (shrivel and dry out) and remain attached to the tree. - occasionally fruit are infected early in the season. This results in fruit that ripen early and are rotten at the core. - infected leaves develop "frog-eye leaf spot." The se are circular spots with purplish or reddish edges and light tan interiors. - cankers appear as a sunken, reddish-brown area on infected branches. Cankers often have rough or cracked bark. - cankers may be hard to see. If you see rotten fruit or frog-eye leaf spot, inspect your trees for cankers. - sunken cankers may appear: - on the southwest side of young trees, where winter injury is common. - or at crotches where branches join the main trunk. These areas are typically the last to harden off in fall. How does black rot survive and spread? - black rot is caused by the fungus Diplodia seriata (syn Botryosphaeria obtusa). - the fungus can infect dead tissue as well as living trunks, branches, leaves and fruits. - the black rot fungi survive Minnesota winters in branch cankers and mummified fruit (shriveled and dried fruit) attached to the tree. - in wet weather, spores are released from these infections and spread by wind or splashing water. - leaf spots don't release fungal spores. - the fungus infects leaves and fruit through natural openings or minor wounds. - branches and the trunk are most likely to be infected through dead or damaged wood. - leaf spots don't seriously affect the health of the tree unless many leaves turn yellow and fall off because of the infection (this is rare). How does tree stress affect black rot? - Minnesota's severe cold often injures apple trees. Tree tissue that's damaged by cold is susceptible to infection by black rot. - trees damaged by drought stress or waterlogged soils are more likely to be affected by black rot, including: - apple trees grown on sandy soils without supplemental irrigation. - trees that are not irrigated during particularly dry spells. - trees grown in poorly drained soils. - trees infected by fire blight often later develop black rot. Fireblight results in dead wood that is easily infected by the black rot fungus. How to manage black rot Practice good sanitation Reduce sources of spores for future infections: - prune out dead or diseased branches. - pick all dried and shriveled fruits remaining on the trees. - remove infected plant material from the area. - all infected plant parts should be burned, buried or sent to a municipal composting site. - be sure to remove the stumps of any apple trees you cut down. Dead stumps can be a source of spores. - prune trees when temperatures are below 32 F. February and March are good months to prune in Minnesota. The fungus is not active until spring. - first, prune out all dead branches. Next prune to shape the tree. - by spring, winter cuts will have healed and be less likely to be infected. Maintain tree health by reducing stress: - choose an appropriate site for all new apple trees. - plant only cultivars that are truly hardy for your area. - provide trees with adequate water. - keep fire blight in check. - remove any limbs or trees killed by fireblight to discourage black rot. Fungicide sprays are usually not needed for managing black rot in Minnesota. - consider using fungicides only after you've used good cultural practices and the disease hasn't gone away. - captan and sulfur products are labeled for control of both scab and black rot. A scab spray program including these chemicals may help prevent the frog-eye leaf spot of black rot, as well as the infection of fruit. These sprays will not control or prevent infection of branches. Caution: Mention of a pesticide or use of a pesticide label is for educational purposes only. Always follow the pesticide label directions attached to the pesticide container you are using. Be sure that the area you wish to treat is listed on the label of the pesticide you intend to use. Remember, the label is the law."
